# Welcome to Luna üîÆ

### Step 0. Prepare Environment
```shell
conda create -n luna python=3.9
conda activate luna
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdir results
```

### Step 1. Set up Containers (Optional)
In most cases, you don't need to do this section by yourself. However, if you are curious, there is something you can check out:
* Knowledge Graph Installation (see section 'Installation' in https://shorturl.at/lyKTZ)
* LLM Inference Engine (run 'start_llm.sh'. For local models only)

You can also try the LLM inference engine by CURL:
```
curl 10.246.112.13:8080/generate \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"inputs":"What is Deep Learning?","parameters":{"max_new_tokens":20}}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

### Step 2. Change the config file
#### Adding the OpenAi Key and the choosing the inference model 

[![change](data/openai.png)]

First you have to replace the open_ai_key field in the config file by your own openai key, see more details at [openai_website](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
Second, you have to replace the model_name field in the config file with a valid openai model name. It is highly advised to use "gpt-4-0125-preview" or 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125' models.

#### Changing the metadata files and the case notes files

[![change](data/change_files.png)]

you have to change the "graph_metadata" and the "graph_notes" fields in the config file with the paths to you json file containing the metadata and the case notes data respectively. 

#### Further config changes

[![change](data/testing_srs.png)]

You can change the "test_sr" field in the config file, by specifying the SRs for which you want to test, if you keep this field as an empty list [], the cli will test for all the SRs present in the metadata files that have case notes in the casenote file

The "eval" flag in the config file should be set to true if the user want to evaluate the performance of the model. for the inference case, set this flag to false.

### Step 3. Run the Code
#### Graph Construction Task
To use pre-defined config in the 'data' folder, please try:
```shell
python cli_worker.py --config_path [CONFIG_PATH] --task graph
```

If you would like to use other metadata/notes, please run:
```shell
python cli_worker.py --task graph
```

#### Product_Name/Software_version Inference Task
If you would like to use pre-defined config in the 'data' folder, please try:
```shell
python cli_worker.py --config_path [CONFIG_PATH] --task [product/software]
```

Otherwise, you can also try this one. The script will help you to generate the config:
```shell
python cli_worker.py --task [product/software]
```

Please feel free to let me know if you have any concerns. Thank you!
