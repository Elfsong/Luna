UCS 2.2(2c) KVM to multiple blades is failing
We tried to access KVM using Java 8 Update 60 (advised this would not likely work), and it failed
Verified there was good TCP connectivity from PC to Blade on TCP 2068.
We could see packets hit FI and return.
Advised to try Java 7 Update 40, however 64 bit version was installed.
Reinstalled 32 bit version.
Enabled Java in Browser from Java Control Panel and reduce security to medium.
KVM opened fine from UCS Manager.

Thank you for your response.
We have planned firmware update on our UCS infrastructure (2.2.2c to 3.1.2b) tomorrow (09-Dec-2016) starting 10 AM SGT.
However during our tomorrow's maintenance we are planning not to  update the firmware of the blades in the UCS infrastructure (i.e.
firmware of the FIs + IOMs on 3 chassis would be updated).
Reason to stage the blade firmware update, is that we have plan to upgrade the hypervisor version the blades starting Jan'2017.
We would like to understand is it advisable / supported / any know issues to run the FIs & IOMs on higher version and Blade on lower version of firmware.

May I check are converged network adapter firmware version installed on these server blade is also compatible with the new 3.1.2b version?

It is supported if you run server in lower version or version equals to UCS Infrastructure.
As shared earlier, you can check for the supported UCS Blade server versions corresponding to Infrastructure: Where Vertically we have Host firmware version (B/C series server) and horizontally we have UCS Infrastructure version.
So for UCS Infra at 3.1.2b, minimum supported host firmware version is 2.2.(1).

Problem Description: CUCM 12.5(1) SU3 || LSC Status Not Accurate
Troubleshooting Performed:
++ Used the same profile as in customers environment to reproduce the issue.
++ Currently, phone is registered and shows upgrade success
++ We have verified both the non-working and working LSC status have the same CAPF certificate.
++ When we run install/upgrade it shows upgrade success
++ However when we go back to phone and without making any changes we click save then it changes the state to none
++ This is an expected behaviour and will only show the current state.
++ I clicked on save with the change in description and state changed to None.
++ I checked the stale LSC’s and it does not show any stale entries
++ However, when I check on the phone, I could see LSC is installed
++ If you go to device->phone and related links-> drop down -> CAPF report in file
++ You can generate the “CAPF report in file” which will display only the phones which has CAPF regardless of the status message.","['11.5.1', '12.5.1', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', 'CM SERVICE - ALL OTHERS']",THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW,THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_HW,True

Problem Description:

User is having issues reaching to servers on vlan 734 from outside.

Base on capture for some reason the source IP in the capture taken on the CSM is showing the server Vlan IP.

Servers are reachable through VIP with no problem.

User stated that since he remembered they been having this issue and that no other Vlan is having this issue.

My name is Kevin Yang from Content Network team and I am delighted to take ownership of your service request.
From the case notes, you are seeing the RX Overflow Error and packet, Is my understanding correct?
Thanks you for providing the show-tech from CSM, I've checked it and have below findings.
1)      From 'TCP statistics', there is a big drop counter on t_fifo Overflow,
t_fifo Overflow                            20428730    29652
2)      There is a big counter on 'TX FIFO Full'
TX FIFO Full                               807117      367759
TX Window Full                             46057251    18004977
3)      Statistics from 'Session Statistics'
Packets Drop: Slowpath limit exceeded    90792994   2865       0
From the all above statistics information, it indicates that the CSM has been overloaded.
I would like to recommend you to reach your SE since  the environment needs to be scaled further to handle the traffic levels.
Please let me know if this information confirms that the CSM is reaching the limitations.
For your convenience I have included my contact details below.
Please feel free to contact me if you need any other help or if you may have any comment regarding this issue.","['THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', 'CSM']",CSM,WS-X6066-SLB-APC=,True

Incorrect ""input bytes"", ""output bytes"" reading for ""show interfaces mgmtEth""

Conditions:
Registers values are read every 10 seconds. Once in a while register value is being read in-correctly. Ignore invalud register read.

Workaround:
Next register read is fine. No workaround.

It could be seen intermittently as in this case when incorrect read for the sensor is done.
Please find the answers to the queries below :
*   If so, what's the impact of the bug? Does it cause traffic impact?
The defect is cosmetic and there is no service impact.
The sensor value is incorrectly read and corrected when the next read is done for the same
*   From the bug description below, there is workaround, what's the implication to the production service if this is not fixed over the long haul?
There is no workaround for this bug.
The bug will intermittently throw syslog errors which can be supressed if required.
No service impact to the production
*   Will there be any SMU to address this bug? Or Cisco planned to release it under the IOS-XR 6.4.2 Roadmap?
There is no exisiting SMU for 6.4.2 and the release is end of maintenance so there will be no further fix released for the same.

3) Cisco IOS XR Software Unauthorized Information Disclosure Vulnerability (CSCvy33646

2) Are there any other conditions to be categorized as vulnerable other than IOS-XR Version itself?
3) What is Cisco's plans for an SMU for mitigation? (FYI: current node is running v6.6.3 SP6)
4) In the event, we would have to upgrade to the recommended versions, will there be any impacts when we move from the current 32 bits IOS-XR to 64 bits IOS-XR and could it cause any compatibility issues with the current hardware installed?

Thank you for your time on the webex.
Summary of the webex:
*   Customer triggered Segment creation task yesterday and it pushed the config for 267+ devices and got struck for 73 devices.
*   When BU joined the call today, we did not see on going provisioning activity, There is no info in resource lock, Looks spf-service is not getting provision message from network programmer.
*   SPF framework took out the lock after 6 hours.
*   Previous TAC engineer found that 1600 message in dna.lan.common.service queue messages are in ready state and it’s not consumed by consumer.
*   We have known defect for this  (CSCvy10747 Cisco DNA Centre 1.3.3.7 messages in dna.lan.common.service queue blocking subsequent LAN Automation)
*   Investigated the messages in queue, Couple of them are EWVirtualNetworkContext and most of them are StackAdditionNotificationMessage , All of the StackAdditionNotificationMessage message are came from the device running IOS-XE Image 16.12.1s.
We know another known behaviour from device if the entphysicalcontainedin mib value changed , DNAC Inventory will post the StackAdditionNotificationMessage.
(CSCvy34888)
·                     Since I did not see any progress happening in any of the services , I try to recover the cluster.
·                     Restarted spf-service and common-service and network design to see its consuming the message, did not happen messages are not consumed.
*   Purged the message from the dna.lan.common.service.
*   Saved the Fabric, Those 73 devices involved on Fabric provision and all of them provisioned except one device and its failed due to Connectivity Issue.
*   Customer has enabled TACACS credential and firewall is blocking that device.
*   Customer performed another segment creation, Static port configuration and all of them went fine.
As discussed on the call , We have reduced the severity of the case to P3 and keeping it in monitoring state for now.
Please let us know if you have any further queries and we will be glad to assist you on it.","['NA - COMPONENT ONLY', '2.2.3.4', '16.12.04', '2.1.2.7', '2.2.2.9', '2.2.2.8', '1.3.1.4', '2.3.3.4', '2.3.3.7', '1.3.3.7', '17.03.03', '2.2.3.5', '2.2.3.6', '4.0.4b', '2.1.2.6']",1.3.3.7,DN2-HW-APL-XL,True

DNA was not aware of the aaa servers on the wlc so when it provisioned the wlc it deleted the services on the wlc wlans; we fixed this by resyncking the wlc with the dna after adding all the aaa service on each wlan and reprovisioning.

• After the upgrade, they provisioned the 5520 WLC and see if the WLANs were getting replaced or updated.
  • According to the config preview, audit logs, and the config comparison chart, the WLANs got replaced instead of getting edited.

• Myself, Jay, and Daisy explained to the customer again why that is happening.
  • The DNAC just got done upgrading, so there are bound to be config changes.
  • They made some changes at the site level, so the DNAC will be pushing configs from the site level, not at the global level.
  • They also made some changes on the Wireless page by pressing the ""Configure AAA"" button and selected the ISE server from the drop-down menu.

***** July 19th, 2022 *****
• Samir confirmed that upgrading the DNAC to 2.2.2.9, on their production DNAC, fixed the hundreds of line config changes that would be pushed to the WLC.
  • The DNAC is now updating/replacing if it needs to be updated/replaced and add new config if the config isn't on the WLC already.

• We explained how the naming system worked involving the profile name on the WLC.
  • The DEs of the WLC purposefully created a 32-character limit on the profile name of the WLANs.
    • There was issues in the past when the DEs tried to extend the character limit, so they changed it back to being just 32-characters.
• Customer will need to make sure that every site, building, and floor have unique characters, so that the profile name on the WLC GUI will be unique too.

• Customer gave permission to close the case.","['NA - COMPONENT ONLY', '2.2.3.4', '16.12.04', '2.1.2.7', '2.2.2.9', '2.2.2.8', '1.3.1.4', '2.3.3.4', '2.3.3.7', '1.3.3.7', '17.03.03', '2.2.3.5', '2.2.3.6', '4.0.4b', '2.1.2.6']",2.2.2.9,DN2-HW-APL-XL,True

What was done, before attempting this Host Onboarding: 
Wanted to push couple of aaa security command to all of their ASR Routers, so created Template with following commands:
aaa local authentication attempts max-fail 3
Security passwords min-length
And created Routing template and pushed to this command to ASR routers. Since they were not able to push All ASR routers, after pushed to couple of devices and they disassociate with Network Profile and created another Profile and pushed another set of devices.
- Looks like this provision went fine. 
- Compliance check was ran and its showing compliance Error in Inventory page.

2/18 webex :
BU engineer Elumalai updated the database, but still getting provision errors.
Root cause is deviceinfo lost the relationship with devicesettings, so while customer try to provision the device with this state, Service Provisioning Request (SPR) got messed up and its updated the snapshot value into database as deviceinfo with null reference of devicesettings.
When we do config preview, snapshot will not be updated in database.
Since customer is (not?) allowed to do any provision activity then, was not able to proceed further.

3/4 webex:
Elumalai checked further db outputs and fixes to non-production DNAC at 172.26.81.34.
Confirmed provision (& preview) working, as long as routing template is not included. Noted that the latter caveat is also fixed in 2.2.2.8 / 2.2.3.5.
Compliance summary infobox is also working after refunning compliance check.

I believe you were hitting CSCux53429 on your ASA which was causing the admin context to not create properly.
It is resolved in version 9.6.1, but if you were to upgrade your ASAs you'd also likely have to upgrade the 9300 chassis because as per the compatibility guide that version is only supported in FXOS 1.1.4:
http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/compatibility/asamatrx.html#pgfId-139390
However we were able to workaround it by reloading the ASA.
It's a condition that seems to be caused by creating and deletion of contexts, so it was likely triggered by something that was being configured today and I would not expect you to see the issue in production.
As discussed, I will proceed with the closure of this SR.","['ASA', 'CISCO FIRESIGHT DEFENSE CENTER', '971.4', '4.8.1.157', '6.2.2.81', '962.7', '6.2.3.15.38', 'FPHIGH', '2.1.1.77', '2.2.2.91', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', 'FXOS', '6.4.0.7.53', '6.4.0.102', '9.7.1.4', '9.8.3', '6.2.3.79', '9.8', '6.1.0.330', '981.7', '6.2.0.1.59', '981', '9.14.2', 'IPS', '9.6.2', '9.10.1.42', '2.8.1.152', '2.2.2.26', '6.4.0.9.62', '984.3']",ASA,FPR9K-SM-24,True

Hi Hai Biao,
Thanks for the update.
As agreed I'm going to close this case out for you.
I hope that I have provided the support that you expected and you are satisfied with the overall service of this case.
Thanks for your time and patience in this matter.
I wanted to make you aware of a free tool created by the TAC called the ASA CLI Analyzer.
The ASA CLI Analyzer is a smart SSH client with internal TAC tools and knowledge integrated.
It features tools written and used by TAC Engineers like:
*   System analysis on the ASA to detect some known issues such as system problems, configuration mistakes, and best practice violations.
*   Top Talker tool identifies which connections are passing the most traffic
*   ASA Packet-tracer Tool, and others
The FREE download is available at https://cway.cisco.com/go/sa
Here is the closure summary.

124,680633993,emailin,"Hi, Please do maintain the priority as P2, when I have my answeres I would self request 4r priority downgrade, your patience & understanding is much appreciated.
In short below is my understanding kindly correct me if it is wrong.
1.
Recomendation is not to have teaming (ESXi) & failover @ UCS configured.
2.
If we use both (as with our case), it is expected to have network disruptions when ever an event which could tigger the vNIC to failover between the IOMs? Kindly help me understand why the mismatch of identity reported on replacing IOM, is this expected? and the scenarios during which mismatch condition expected to arise? To resolve the mismatch condition what is the action recommended? Yst there was quite a bit of troubleshooting carried out, which include reseating physically the new IOM twice, port on FI was reset multiple times & at one point the TAC engineer was confident that to recover one of the uplink the chassis requires a shutdown, can any of these be avoided?

VNIC’s have been failing over to and from IOM A during the process of IOM B bring up.
2.
I have read in the case notes that you have NIC teaming configured on ESXi servers from the OS end (Please confirm the same) 3.
When you have both NIC teaming (ESXi) and VNIC failover (UCS) configured, there are scenarios that can arise when one of the fabric path (IOM B) goes down causing network to flap continuously and lose connectivity as shown in the outputs above.
Please find the best practice whitepaper in the below link.

Problem description:
Maximum capacity for NAT/PAT
Actions taken:
Number of xlates doesn't have hardcoded system limit.
Maximum number of xlates depends of the available memory, and that depends of the other processes on the box (ACL, inspection, routing...
depending what you have configured, and how much traffic is going through the box).
In addition to that, high end platforms have more resources.
Available resources are shared between different processes, and that is why there is no limit defined - it simply depends of the available memory at the time.

====================
CSM is having multiple issues.
Resolution :
============
The CSM client login fails and we have to restart the services everytime the issue happens.
Please upgrade the CSM to patch SP1 from the following link :  https://software.cisco.com/download/release.html?mdfid=286310121&flowid=80543&softwareid=282773974&release=4.12%20SP1&relind=AVAILABLE&rellifecycle=&reltype=latest
Many ASA devices are added to the CSM but none of them have their policies discovered on CSM.
Please discover policies on the CSM and then try to detect out of band changes.
I will go ahead and close this SR.

Similar tests in my lab as well yield similar result as what we have seen in your environment.
The NSF or graceful restart does not seem to kick in as the Link between the ASA and the neighbor is down.
With default OSPF timers we see 10-12 ping loss .
This time is taken for the failover to happen + build OSPF neighborship with the new Active ASA.
For the Graceful restart to work as expected, a failover or a reload of the Active ASA seem to show expected results.
I am further testing by reducing the dead timers to see if we can tune them to minimize the impact as the NSF feature does not seem to help here.","['ASA', 'CISCO FIRESIGHT DEFENSE CENTER', '971.4', '4.8.1.157', '6.2.2.81', '962.7', '6.2.3.15.38', 'FPHIGH', '2.1.1.77', '2.2.2.91', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', 'FXOS', '6.4.0.7.53', '6.4.0.102', '9.7.1.4', '9.8.3', '6.2.3.79', '9.8', '6.1.0.330', '981.7', '6.2.0.1.59', '981', '9.14.2', 'IPS', '9.6.2', '9.10.1.42', '2.8.1.152', '2.2.2.26', '6.4.0.9.62', '984.3']",ASA,FPR-9300-E-K9,True

From the logs, we suspect multiple issue.
1)The source itself is loosing the routes when the failover happens.
2)The ASA when fails over also looses the route.
This should be fixed in 9.6(2) incase we are hitting bug CSCuy98769.

It was nice talking to you.
Please find the summary of our conversation below,
Syslog messages received on syslog server from ASA was showing extra hash code on all the logs.
The local buffer was not showing any has code on the logs.
I confirmed that ASA is running the suggested configuration from the syslog server end.
Only difference was that server recommended for sending specific messages but ASA was sending level debugging.
I provided configuration for sending all notification logs and certain debugging level messages using list.
ASA didn't had any configuration that can attach a hash code with the logs.

We suggested an upgrade of the FPR chassis to one of the fixed releases mentioned in the bug.

Unfortunately there is no workaround and the only option is to upgrade the FXOS for the platform.  You can upgrade to 2.0(1.68) and above as 2.0(1.54) has the fix.

In the current case it would be better to upgrade the FXOS to 2.0.1.135.

From the ASA end it can be 9.6(2.7) which should be having the fixes for most of the bugs.

The OSPF bug which you have provided has indeed been fixed on the case. If in case your testing has revealed that it is not then you are very likely hitting a different problem.

I am working with Escalation/Developer Team.
The decode of coredumps as reported before points to have been triggered by execution of capture and/or editing the ACL(s) used on the capture commands.
Checking the ASA show tech I see ACLs named with “cap” on 4 different contexts.
As per the developer it looks that one ACL used on the capture was being edited and this triggered the crash.
In order to track find the root cause of this crash I have raised the following defect:
https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCve94886/?reffering_site=dumpcr
Once again if you can confirm whether it is possible that ACLs used on captures were being edited or any other capture/ACLs actions, that will be very helpful.
As I see that you have logging trap debugging on your contexts, you may check the syslog server and see if there is any log message close to the crash timestamp showing configuration changes.
Here is an example:

Answer:
The 'bytes' value represents the total bytes transferred during the life of the connection before the connection was torn down.

Based on what you provided, those appear to be new connection attempts.
I googled TCP port '61616', and that port is used for ActiveMQ.
Based on what I read about it, ActiveMQ is designed for the purpose of sending messages between two applications.
So, it makes some sense that those are new connection attempts.
I've also provided a link to the ASA syslog message guide.
This guide provides explanations for the different syslogs, such as '106100'.

Li,
I am the current engineer assigned to the case as mentioned by Jorge as part of the FTS.
Before reaching out to the ASA BU we need more detailed information to investigate the problem.
I have checked the ASA log messages and show tech attached to the case so far.
The logs does show the failover reporting the ASA failover peer units not able to reach to each other.
This could be caused by either some issue on the ASA/Firepower chassis itself, or a result of an errors on the switch side in which the chassis ports are connected.
We have checked the log information provided from the ASA/Firepower but they don’t show any helpful information to determine the root cause.
I have made a sanity check on the ASA/Firepower but nothing called my attention.
The ASA/chassis looks healthy besides the failover messages.
We need the following information for more complete understanding and try work on the root cause:
>  Network topology diagram, specifying L2 interfaces IDs of the connections between the ASA/Firepower and the Switch
>  Log messages from the switch side during the outage","['ASA', 'CISCO FIRESIGHT DEFENSE CENTER', '971.4', '4.8.1.157', '6.2.2.81', '962.7', '6.2.3.15.38', 'FPHIGH', '2.1.1.77', '2.2.2.91', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', 'FXOS', '6.4.0.7.53', '6.4.0.102', '9.7.1.4', '9.8.3', '6.2.3.79', '9.8', '6.1.0.330', '981.7', '6.2.0.1.59', '981', '9.14.2', 'IPS', '9.6.2', '9.10.1.42', '2.8.1.152', '2.2.2.26', '6.4.0.9.62', '984.3']",962.7,FPR-CH-9300-AC,True

++Understood there concern about TAC hovering over OSPF issue.

++Those OSPF logs have always been coming from long time and as per them we need to ignore those logs.

++Moreover , ASA is not running OSPF and the interfaces should not go in testing because of OSPF issue.

++Customers team will be working on connectivity side and they want us to investigate to find out if it is an ASA or FXOS issue.

++As per there request , i will be escalating the case to BU and simultaneously going through the logs at my end.","['ASA', 'CISCO FIRESIGHT DEFENSE CENTER', '971.4', '4.8.1.157', '6.2.2.81', '962.7', '6.2.3.15.38', 'FPHIGH', '2.1.1.77', '2.2.2.91', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', 'FXOS', '6.4.0.7.53', '6.4.0.102', '9.7.1.4', '9.8.3', '6.2.3.79', '9.8', '6.1.0.330', '981.7', '6.2.0.1.59', '981', '9.14.2', 'IPS', '9.6.2', '9.10.1.42', '2.8.1.152', '2.2.2.26', '6.4.0.9.62', '984.3']",962.7,FPR-CH-9300-AC,True

Problem Details: Hi Team,

We have configured WLC for TrustSec with following steps:-
1) Configured TrustSec General Settings, with Device ID and Password
2) Configured Radius Authentication server with support for ""CoA"" and PAC Provisioning.

Configuration at ISE:-
1) Configured TrustSec settings with Device ID, password and CoA

After these configurations, we are not getting PAC at WLC.

Below is the error that we get on WLC:-

CTS-Provisioning: Stop PAC provisioning timer for Radius server.

Please help in resolving this issue.

Thanks

Problem Details: ASA Failover Sudden Failover ASA Failover Sudden Failover timestamp : 2018-07-07T04:40:33.000+0000 || updatedby : akrastog || type : RESOLUTION SUMMARY || visibility : External || details : *   The same reason was seen with the older version. From the notes, I can see that you were running version FXOS 2.1.1.7 which was very old to the version “2.2.2.26” and ASA version to 9.8.2

As per their analysis, there is some authentication requests which were going to the Smart Account Server which is crashing the FXOS. This is when the License is Out of Compliance.

*   As discussed, FXOS in 9300 with ASA module communicates with Smart Account Server(Cloud account) for Licenses on ASA’s behalf.
*   When we check the FXOS with ASA as Primary/Standby, Status was : ‘Authorised’. However, another one(Secondary/Active) showed OOC(Out of Compliance).

Primar/Standby unit:


License Authorization:

  Status: AUTHORIZED on Mar 25 10:40:44 2018 SGT

  Last Communication Attempt: SUCCESS on Mar 25 10:40:44 2018 SGT

  Next Communication Attempt: Apr 24 10:40:43 2018 SGT

  Communication Deadline: Jun 23 10:34:42 2018 SGT


Secondary/Active:


License Authorization:

  Status: OUT OF COMPLIANCE on Mar 25 10:29:04 2018 SGT

  Last Communication Attempt: SUCCESS on Mar 28 14:35:07 2018 SGT

  Next Communication Attempt: Mar 29 02:35:06 2018 SGT

  Communication Deadline: Jun 26 14:29:05 2018 SGT

  *   We needed to find the reason on why the Module is in OOC. For that we checked the Smart Server Account and we saw Event Log as ‘Insufficient License for 9300 for standard feature’.
  *   As discussed, there is a difference in Registration and Utilising the Feature. Other ASA’s are registered, However, only the concerned one using the ‘standard feature.
  *   We verified the same by accessing the ‘show run license’ on those ASAs:

Concerned ASA:


FirePwASA-SVRFRM-CC/pri/stby# sh run license

license smart

 feature tier standard


However, we don’t see this or any other feature enabled for other ASAs.


So, as per the BU’s update, frequent renew request is causing the unit with OOC status to crash. So, if we can resolve the OOC then, the crash issue will resolve.

- Removed the 'feature tier standard' command and issue got resolved.","['ASA', 'CISCO FIRESIGHT DEFENSE CENTER', '971.4', '4.8.1.157', '6.2.2.81', '962.7', '6.2.3.15.38', 'FPHIGH', '2.1.1.77', '2.2.2.91', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', 'FXOS', '6.4.0.7.53', '6.4.0.102', '9.7.1.4', '9.8.3', '6.2.3.79', '9.8', '6.1.0.330', '981.7', '6.2.0.1.59', '981', '9.14.2', 'IPS', '9.6.2', '9.10.1.42', '2.8.1.152', '2.2.2.26', '6.4.0.9.62', '984.3']",2.1.1.77,FPR9K-SM-24,True

Resolution Summary --> We went on WebEx and discussed the issue, we found that ASA statistics are fine and logs are being sent to the syslog server as well.
The reason for uneven number of logs related to build and teardown of connections is because we are trying to check this for a particular time period and there is no certainty that during that time period the connection was build or if it was terminated.
There is a definite chance that connection was actually build before that and might have terminated during that time frame or maybe a connection is formed during that timeframe but not terminated in that timeframe.
Thus it is not possible to have same number of logs in a particular timeframe.

Problem Details: Is it possible to run packet capture on IPS and filter this according to its destination subnet and port, then offload the file to ftp.

  We tried the commands below but it only filters one ip for tagged and untagged data.

	-w capture.pcap -s 1518 -c 5000 host 192.0.2.1
	-w capture.pcap -s 1518 -c 5000 'host 192.0.2.1 or (vlan and host 192.0.2.1)' 

 What we need is to capture according to subnet and port.

SSL Certificate Signed Using Weak Hashing Algorithm

CVE-2004-2761 ""SSL Certificate Signed Using Weak Hashing Algorithm""
Firepower/FMC is not affected by this vulnerability because of below reason.
""SSL certificates are used in two places in the product:
for the web server and for the [SSL] tunnel connections between Sourcefire devices.
Web server - The default SSL keys that ship with the product for the web server use an MD5 hash.
However, this key is not signed by a trusted CA.
The customer can replace this certificate with their own that uses a stronger hash algorithm.
[SSL] tunnel connections - The tunnel connections also use SSL keys that are signed using MD5 hashes.
However, these certificates are signed by a CA that is internal to the DC and only this CA is trusted for authenticating the certificates.
Therefore, an attacker would not be able to spoof a valid certificate for these connections.""

Problem Details: Intermittent dropping the traffic by the P2P DENY policy as it is identifying the application as BitTorrent Intermittent dropping the traffic by the P2P DENY policy as it is identifying the application as BitTorrent timestamp : 2019-04-11T07:22:41.000+0000 || updatedby : raghukul || type : RESOLUTION SUMMARY || visibility : Internal || details : Issue 1: Mirror.nus.edu.org getting classified as BitTorrent
=============================================

he website  http://mirror.nus.edu.org though it is classified as Educational Institution, the content hosted on this site is basically firmware’s which are Linux variants.
++ When the user selects on the sub-directories there is an option to download the firmware with one of the below choices:

[cid:image001.png@01D3F1AD.612383B0]

++ Now, at this point if the user selects any option apart from the “torrent” download option, the rule evaluation works correctly and the application is not detected as P2P (BitTorrent) which is expected. The device treats this connection as a normal HTTP download.

++ However, if the user at this point selects the “torrent” download option which is the 5th entry in the image above. The download is initiated via the torrent client because the file is a torrent download.
++ The connection event at this point on the device are as shown below. This is where we detect the application as BitTorrent and this is the expected behavior.


Issue 2: Tag-Based versus Category based App Detectors:
==============================================

++ When we initiated the connection, we observed that the application protocol was detected as “HTTP” and the Web application was detected as “Web Browsing” for all the working and non-working scenario.
++ However, what is crucial is the “Client” field which was getting detected as BitTorrent and for that connection which was not getting blocked the “Client” field was rightly getting detected as “Browsers” (Chrome/Opera/Firefox).

++ The important factor to determine is how we decide on the “Client Field”. This field looks into the tags associated with the application detector and then based on that it determines the client in addition to looking at the user agent field.
++ In the past, we had seen false positive in client field detection when tags are used as part of the app detection. I was able to recreate the behavior associated with SSL and HTTPS traffic.

++ The rule that is configured to block BitTorrent is based on “Category” and “Tags”.
++ When it comes to app-detection and tags being used as criteria, it will not be precise as we are not really looking into the content that is being downloaded. Hence in your case, we observed that the connection even to the home page was being detected as a client with BitTorrent.

What do we do to avoid these false positives?
=====================================

++ The rule created to block the BitTorrent App needs to be configured based on Application Filter.
++ We need to get away with the Tag-based detection to make it more efficient and avoid the false positives.


Issue 3: Increasing the aggressiveness associated with BitTorrent:
===================================================

Increasing BitTorrent Detection Aggressiveness
----------------------------------------------------------------
We enhanced the system to share more information about specific flows throughout the system that can assist on the identification of a BitTorrent host, with the use of some specific aggressiveness settings we have allowed customers to add.

•    These settings can be added by editing the /var/sf/userappid.conf file in the FMC CLI and then doing a Policy Deploy to send all these configurations to the devices which are registered to the FMC.
•    These settings are NOT enabled by default to avoid any potential false positive issues that may occur in the system.
•    These capabilities are created by flagging specific hosts, or servers on a host as BitTorrent whenever we are not able to identify its traffic through any of our regular application detection algorithms. In other words, these capabilities only get triggered when the traffic we see is Unknown.

-Below is the configuration line needed to be add in /var/sf/userappid.conf :

appid<tab>bittorrent_aggressiveness<tab>80
•    Where <tab> is the actual tab space. It is very important to make sure that Tabs are added there instead of spaces, sometimes vi can mask a tab with a space so make sure that we are truly using tabs when we are adding these configurations.

-As described earlier, after doing this change in FMC, the policy has to be deployed again to the managed/concerned devices ( edit any rule in the access control policy, click on any of the tab in the rule e.g. application then click on save and you will get the option to deploy the same policy to the concerned devices )

+ And one more important thing we noticed from the attached syslogs is that there is only a single IP address ( 172.27.225.212 ) in all the 4 events of application getting allowed thus please fetch a report on historic data from syslog server ( application : BitTorrent, action : allow ) and analyze the output to make sure the IP address which are having these allow action to have further check on the machines.

+ In addition of this, please share the +,- 5 minutes logs from the time of occurrence of the concerned event i.e. Oct  9 03:59:52 , +,-5 mins and Oct  9 03:05:18 +,-5 mins to do further analysis.


Issue 4: After the upgrade, there was misclassification of VPN Client and AV Agent
================================================================

++ Issue was caused due to a bad app detector.
++ Raised a new defect with the engineering team.
++ Upgrade on the VDB solved the concern


Coming to the testing related to P2P and torrent blocking, here is what I used in the lab and was able to block all torrent traffic in the lab scenario:


  1.  Created a rule with the URL block with category highlighted as P2P (peer to peer)
     *   This category includes most of the torrent hosting websites.
     *   Advantage: We block known bad right upfront without putting load on snort to determine the applications.
  2.  Created a rule with app detector as p2p category
     *   This will address the concerns related to sites which are regular websites but support download of content via the torrent application.
     *   This rule is already configured in your case and we do not need any change for this.

Note: The URL rule created based on category should be placed above the app based rule. Logging to enabled only at the start of the connection.

Analysis Done:
============


  1.  Whenever we have application detection configured, the device needs some packets to identify what the application is.
  2.  Now, when we looked at the connection events on the FMC, we saw that the count for initiator and responder packets is non-zero (which is expected) also the bytes transferred under initiator and responder bytes was non-zero (again this is expected).
  3.  After this, we determine the application is torrent and then block the connection.
  4.  However, in the meantime the upstream device sees first few packets. In our case from the logs shared on the ASA we can see these connections having few bytes transferred.

This is expected behaviour and does not mean that torrent is not getting blocked.

Follow up questions for BitSight on report regeneration and addition details:


  1.  Can we have the amount of data transferred in the connection which is marked by them as torrent?
  2.  Additionally is it possible to provide details on the URL being referenced while the data is being downloaded?","['ASA', 'FPHIGH', 'CISCO FIREPOWER', '6.2.3.5', '6.2.3', '6.2', 'CISCO FIRESIGHT DEFENSE CENTER']",FPHIGH,FP8300-STACK,True

Though you have decided to upgrade FXOS to version 2.2(2.26), we much more strongly recommend that you upgrade to FXOS version 2.3(1.88) -- the newest available version.
This FXOS release is the most compatible with the greatest number of different application versions (FTD or ASA) that can run on the security modules of your FPR9300 firewall(s), and it resolves some significant security vulnerabilities (release notes: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/fxos/fxos231/release/notes/fxos231_rn.html).
However, the choice of software version to use will be entirely up to you.
Staying with your originally-planned software versions, please download the following files from cisco.com...
---
[FXOS]
fxos-k9.2.2.1.70.SPA
fxos-k9.2.2.2.26.SPA
[ASA]
cisco-asa.9.8.2.28.SPA.csp

The release notes document for FXOS version 2.2(2) (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/fxos/fxos222/release/notes/fxos222_rn.html) contains instructions for completing the FXOS upgrade.
The same release notes document outlines how to upgrade the ASA software as well.
The general order of operations...
---
1.
Download the software images from cisco.com.
2.
Upload the software images to the firewall chassis (using either Firepower Chassis Manager or the FXOS CLI).
3.
Upgrade the firewall chassis to FXOS version 2.2(1.70).
4.
Upgrade the firewall chassis to FXOS version 2.2(2.26).
5.
Upgrade the security module(s) to ASA version 9.8(2.28).

If you are not using standalone firewalls, review the FXOS release notes for further instructions for failover and cluster deployments.

Correctable errors are not a sign of hardware failure and are expected behavior.
After clearing the system event logs and resetting CIMC the fault cleared in vCenter.

271,684874466,emailin,"Hi Hai Biao,
Apologies for the delay in response.
SNMP queue full error is usually seen when monitor devices are excessively polling the interface statistics.
MFIB error message could be caused by the connection problem between supervisor and slot module or a bug such as CSCto92891<https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCto92891/?reffering_site=dumpcr>.
If it’s a connection problem, MFIB error should stop after module reload.
As for the bug description of CSCvi12071<https://apac01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbst.cloudapps.cisco.com%2Fbugsearch%2Fbug%2FCSCvi12071%2F%3Freffering_site%3Ddumpcr&data=02%7C01%7Chaibiao%40ncs.com.sg%7C2b05c1d95306427be72c08d5eea817f6%7Cca90d8f589634b6ebca99ac468bcc7a8%7C1%7C0%7C636677328100514884&sdata=LIIx8cRDmxP2zwBF3%2BOP%2BH%2B0UzuXzeb7gSsbmoPftd8%3D&reserved=0>, because this bug was filed quite a while ago, I couldn’t confirm the exact root cause of this issue but here’s what’s on the description.

++ Later ELAM collected on standby switch of VSS1.
++ This ELAM and other troubleshooting proven that the ARP was not passing from VSS1 standby switch to VSS2.
++ Finally isolated to bug CSCve73632.

Monitoring Action Plan :
========================
Considering the past issues TAC and NUS followed the day to day action plan mentioned below,
 
How to perform the sanity check / day to day Verifications ?
 
1)
Show version
Verify the uptime of VSS set up and the current control processor.

2)
Show module switch all
Verity all the modules and their online diagnostics staus.
 
3)
Show process cpu history
Verify the stability of CPU usage for last 72 hours.
 
4)
show  processes cpu sorted | exclude 0.00
Verify the current cpu usage; should be within ~40%.
 
5)
show  processes memory sorted
Verify the free memory; used memory should not be more than ~60% than total.
 
6)
Show logging
Check for any weird log.
 
7)
Show spanning-tree detail | in ieee|occur|from|is exec
Verify the stability of all the vlans.
 
8)
show  interfaces | in Total output drops|line
Verify if there are any input/output drops. Flushes on interface VLANs are expected in your network of more than 1000 hosts in a single wireless lan.
Flushes pointing to SPD (Selective Packet Discard) for low priority traffic hitting to CPU. This is one of CPU protection mechanism.
 
9)
show platform hardware lif l2 table lif-db entry 0x10800 count 4094
Verify VLAN misprogramming.
LDB Addr, hw_bd and lif should be in synch and in sequence for all configured vlans.
In your case vlans configured in range 1 to 999.
 
Good VLAN hardware programming example for VLAN range 1 to 27 :

VLAN hardware programming happens individually on each and every line card.
So you need to login to each line card and verify the output of the above command.
 
How to login to module 1 on switch 1?
-> remote login switch-id 1 module 1
Then collect “show platform hardware lif l2 table lif-db entry 0x10800 count 4094”
->  exit
 
Same way you can login to all modules and collect the respective output.
 
To collect the same output from hot-standby SUP, you need to enable the standby console.
 
How to enable standby console?
config terminal
redundancy
main-cpu
standby console enable
end
 
Login to standby using “remote login standby” OR “remote login switch-id 2 module 3” command.
Then collect “show platform hardware lif l2 table lif-db entry 0x10800 count 4094” from hot standby SUP.
Exit.
 
How to disable standby console?
config terminal
redundancy
main-cpu
no standby console enable
end
 
 
Sanity check for :-
-VLAN mis-programming
-CPU
-Memory
-Spanning tree
-Drops
-Logs 
etc. 
 
Suggests everything looks good on both the VSS set ups for more than a week.

Here is the summary of session.
You have syslog logging enabled for 2 syslog servers and CSM server.
The primary issue is that the firewall is not sending syslog’s to any of them.
We verified the config on both the firewalls (9300 running ASA) and confirmed ASA is sending the syslogs and its most likely an issue on or from next hop and needs to be checked on the internal network.
As discussed, I will reduce the priority to 3 for now.
Please check internally with the next hop and internal network and let me know if any questions.

•	As per the previous engineer we are hitting the defects, CSCvk70748, CSCvj79271 and CSCvn12442.
•	We have applied the latest patch on ISE to get the fix for above defects.
•	We monitor the system for a while and collected the logs to check if we are hitting the defect.
•	As per the logs, we noticed that we are noticed that there are high CPU’s on the system which is caused by the defect CSCvk32508.
•	We have secure syslog enabled on ISE without any root certificates. This causes multiple errors in the logs and affects the performance on the nodes.
•	Since we are not using secure syslog server, we have disabled secure syslog target
•	After the above, we have analysed the logs for few times and confirmed that we are not seeing any further issues.","['2.3.0.298', '2.4.0', '2.3.0', 'ISE']",2.3.0.298,SNS-3595-K9,True

Affected client MAC address:
E0:33:8E:4E:E3:FF
Actions taken:
A general review of WLC configuration was performed.
We performed connectivity tests.
From PATH: WLANs > ""wlanId"" > Security > Layer 3 Security, we disabled feature:
Radius Server Override Interface Enabled
Authentication issue got solved.
Observations:
After disabling ""Radius Server Override Interface Enabled"", authentication issue got solved.
When this feature is disabled, authentication packets are going to be sourced by WLC Management IP address.
When this feature is enabled, authentication packets are going to be sourced by the dynamic interface IP address where the client is connected.
CU configured another SSID with same configuration.
It was told the client was not able to connect.
We ran debug commands and it seems the client did not reply back so the process timed out.
After another try the client was able to connect.
This seems to be more related about what client replies.

Hi Ye,

As far as I know, rehost is possible, but to perform it we need to locate the existing records.
To do that we will need PAK,SO  or UDI of your MSE running on version 8 and the quantities you need to transfer.

Hi Nikolay,

As per cisco presale team, “MSE 8.x license is not transferrable to CMX 10.x”. Could you confirm on this?

If this is true, we cannot transfer the licenses from existing MSEs to new CMX.

Hello,

My name is Nikolay and I am assisting my colleague Boris on this case.
To transfer the license we will need either the UDI of the source and destination devices or PAK numbers that contain the license and the UDI of the destination device.

Can you confirm if the notification server is reachable from CMX during the time you stopped receiving notifications from CMX?

//This command reports the metrics for every Notification Receiver

CMX#cmxctl metrics notification

//API call which would show the rate at which the notifications are sent from CMX to NB

/api/config/v1/notifications/stats

You can collect Packet captures from CMX to check the flow -

 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless/connected-mobile-experiences/211536-Packet-Captures-on-Connected-Mobile-Expe.html
You can also check with tcpdump whether the packets for notifications are sent out of CMX.

If you have winscp, can you can copy the below files and share them with me -

/opt/cmx/var/log/configuration/error.log



/opt/cmx/var/log/configuration/server.log

You can also use CLI to access files on the CMX to share them with me.

*   HW and SW:
*   CMX
*   10.6.2-72
*   Deployment:
*   Location tracking
*   Problem Description:
*   Customer needs to be able to gather historical client data that includes the RSSI value of the wireless clients
*   When running the cassandraexport command or running API for history clients the same return data like AP, SSID, X and Y coordinates and more information of the wireless element but no RSSI valueAction Plan:
*   Checked internally with Engineering and PM and the recommendation is to use Northbound Notifications for this and gather the historical data from the Northbound Notification Server as from CMX the cassandraexport command and the API for history clients will not provide the RSSI values for historical data
*   Also, advised Ye that if this is a complete need then talk with the account team so they can open a feature request for this and validate it as needed
*   Current Status:
*   From CMX current options and TAC standpoint there is no much that can be done
*   Due to this and since things are clear and option to accomplish the needed is given (Northbound Notification) we are good to go
It's been a pleasure to assist you Ye, I wish you only the best, please be safe!

  1.  The rule that is created based on the L3 parameters for source and destination is as pushed on the device:

  1.  The corresponding hardware rule that gets pushed on the ASIC is as shown below:

    970
    {
        rule_id 268494153;
        action allow;
        src_ip 172.19.20.177/32;
        dst_ip 192.30.64.0/20;
        ip_protocol 6;
        dst_port 443;
    }


  1.  Corresponding to the rule, here is what we saw in the “firewall-engine-debug” we can see the below against the rule which was used:
172.19.20.177-49302 > 192.30.68.112-443 6 AS 1 I 0 no match rule order 122, 'CRQ201080-ccechky_UAT', src network, FQDN and GEO


  1.  The highlighted section above indicates that the SRC network field did not match in the configured rule and hence it moved to the next rule for evaluation.
  2.  Eventually, it got evaluated against the deny rule which blocked it.
  3.  Now, when a specific rule was created, the same traffic was allowed without any issues.

Let me come to the reason why this happened:

  1.  We have a defect CSCvh07446 which is at play here, this is specific to the hardware you have deployed and on the version 6.2.3 itself.
  2.  What happens as part of this defect is when there are rules created based on the “Source” and “Destination” IP networks, it is expanded as a multiplier combination
  3.  Explanation available here: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/firepower-ngfw/200522-Understand-the-Rule-Expansion-on-FirePOW.html
  4.  In some instances, we have seen when the number of combinations has exceeded 4096 possibilities, the rule incorrectly matches.
  5.  4096 is the minimum rule combination on which this was seen first. Hence when there was a lower combination resulted as part of the new rule created, the issue was resolved and that itself is the workaround.
  6.  There is another potential defect here CSCvk16876 which causes this problem.
  7.  These are fixed in 6.2.3.8 and above, 6.3.0.2 and above, 6.4.0 and above.","['6.4.0.102', 'CISCO FIREPOWER', '6.1.0.3.57', 'ASA', '6.2.3.15.38', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', '6.2.3.80', '6.2.3.83', '6.5.0.1', '6.4.0', '6.3.0']",6.2.3.83,FP8300-STK40G-K9,True

++ This logs point out that switch-2 has neighbor learning issue on stack port 1/1 and Stack-port1/2.
++ This can be issue due to stack cable or switch hardware itself.
++ We have already replaced stack cable from your inventory.
++ We need to replace the switch-2 in stack and monitor further.
********************************************************************************

Currently Customer is now replacing the faulty switch with new received switch.
Onsite engineer is now checking the health and performance of the switch.
customer requested assistance while onsite engineer will add the switch in stack.


current status :

we have two switches which need to be replaced and EFA to be processed as well. 
We have RMA and EFA done RMA(801376583), FA ID FA-0465744 
we need to create RMA  and EFA for the switch 2. it was covered under a different contract
As of now logistics added the CCO Sunita Nair to the contract 200221213 on which we have FOC2425U01A (sw 2) covered
we will create the RMA once the system is updated and the EFA as well 

As of now we do not have any further network impact seen. 

we saw the following trace logs

411,691570836,emailin,"Thanks for your time in our webex session.
Please see below summary:
*Checked ISE alarms.
*Checked RADIUS live log details for that Authentication Request Dropped.
*Got CLI access for NAD CC-03-CNT-ES02.
*Checked aaa configuration, radius configuration and CTS configuration.
*RADIUS servers have pac key configured.
*Checked cts pacs but there was no PACs in the switch:
*Checked cts server but there was no information regarding CTS servers although cts authorization list is defined in the switch config.
*Tried to refresh pac but pac still not showing in switch:
At this point we know that as workaround we can reenter pac key configuration, then the switch will be able to renew PAC from ISE server.
According to the findings we gather in our webex session I suspect that we are hitting the following bug - https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvy45135 to confirming it we would need to go through the next action plan:
*Enable runtime components for tldc-rad-nac01 node and set them in DEBUG.
*Take PSN timestamp.
*Got CLI access for NAD CC-03-CNT-ES02.
*Refresh pac.
*Take support bundle and upload it to the case.
Please let me know if you have any questions.","['2.3.0.298', '3.0.0', '16.12.04', 'ISE']",16.12.04,C9300-48U,True

Going through the Authentication report uploaded to the ticket I can see that TrustSec with a PAC is involved. Since the error message is: ""11302 Received Secure RADIUS request without a cts-pac-opaque cisco-av-pair attribute"", we seem to be dealing with PAC expiration which requires a new provisioning operation. In order for this provisioning to occur, ISE needs to receive a new provisioning operation request sent by the supplicant. Depending on the endpoint, the configuration can differ and this has to be checked with the PAC documentation for the specific supplicant. This explains why by removing the AAA configuration on the network device the authentication goes through successfully (i.e. the issue is resolved), since the endpoint initiates a new Secure Radius request, rather than trying to re-authenticate using the regular flow which does not contain the expected  cisco-av-pair attribute. Please, refer to the exact reason for drop and suggested actions:

Failure Reason           1302 Received Secure RADIUS request without a cts-pac-opaque cisco-av-pairattribute
Resolution                 Refer to the documentation for the client's supplicant to perform a new PAC-provisioning operation
Root cause                The request does not have a cisco-av-pair attribute starting with the value cts-pac-opaque. This value is a required attribute for Secure RADIUS requests.

-In the captures we see the Message Authenticator appearing as 0's for the failing scenarios.
-Issue is resolved by removing and readding the PAC key configuration on the switch.
-Since the PAC key needs to be reinitialized automatically, it seems to get stuck, caching issue or a defect.","['2.3.0.298', '3.0.0', '16.12.04', 'ISE']",16.12.04,C9300-48U,True

CSCvu93346 - IOSd/ARP Snoop crash in access_tunnel_oqueue
(https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu93346)
Here’s the information on the defect:
Symptom:
Cat9300 switch controlled by DNAC might reboot unexpectedly when processing ARP packet.
In the crashinfo file generated for the crash we see:

UNIX-EXT-SIGNAL: Segmentation fault(11), Process = ARP Snoop

Conditions:
The issue was seen on Catalyst 9300 in the SDA environment while processing the ARP packet that is sent to the CPU.

Workaround:
unknown yet

Without a workaround present for the version you’re running, it seems that to avoid the same crash happening again, it’s feasible to consider an upgrade of the IOS-XE version to 17.3.2a, which has the fix built-in for this defect.",['16.12.04'],16.12.04,C9300-48U,True

As discussed , I will dispatch the case for 12 AM SGT on 30th October.
As discussed on the call,  below is  a brief summary of the case:
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
1.
ISE high Authentication Latency on 1 PSN  hsdc-rad-nac01 after upgrade from ISE 2.6  to ISE 3.0 patch 3
2.
NTP sync failure issue on Primary PAN node hsdc-pan-nac01
DEVICES:
Platform: SNS-3655-K9
Version: 3.0.0.458
Patch: 3
Serial Number WZP23040NG0

CPU_Cores: 24
RAM: 93 GB
Deployment:
- hsdc-pan-nac01: Primary PAN,PXG  <---------- NTP issue
- tldc-mnt-nac01: MNT
- hsdc-rad-nac01: PSN                          <---------- High Auth latency due to high CPU
- tldc-rad-nac01: PSN
- hsdc-mnt-nac01: MNT
- tldc-pan-nac01: PAN,PXG
ACTION TAKEN:
*   We discussed the objectives and the unexpected behavior witnessed.
*   Application server was stuck in initializing.
*   restarted the services , Application server came back.
*   no core dump generated.
This should be generated if high CPU caused the system crash.
*   George   confirmed that authentication latency was seen earlier along with high CPU:
?  Explained that as Core dump was not generated it is difficult to pinpoint which thread was hogging CPU  and caused the  High latency and  triggered Application server initializing.
?  In case the issue happens again we need to collect thread dump and heap dump from CLI for analysis:
?  We also need the output of ""tech top "" for identify the process causing high CPU.
Here's what @Aaron Sanabria Martinez (asanabri)<mailto:asanabri@cisco.com> troubleshooted regarding NTP after my shift ended:
You noticed that timezone was on UTC ,  the rest of the nodes in the deployment are in Singapore
But you did not complete the step as it will restart the applications server on the node.
Now we noticed that the primary node is having ntp server issues, ntp service is down, when we do #show NTP we get the following error: ""506 Cannot talk to daemon."" .
As  mentioned this issue is related to the following bug: CSCvw03693<https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw03693> which we confirmed by getting the following output from CLI:
hsdc-pan-nac01/admin# show logging system  messages | inc chronyd

2021-10-28T12:46:06.703775+00:00 hsdc-pan-nac01 chronyd[117365]: Fatal error : Could not get chrony uid/gid
2021-10-28T12:46:06.704586+00:00 hsdc-pan-nac01 chronyd: Could not get chrony uid/gid
2021-10-28T12:46:06.717983+00:00 hsdc-pan-nac01 systemd: chronyd.service: control process exited, code=exited status=1
2021-10-28T12:46:06.725924+00:00 hsdc-pan-nac01 systemd: Failed to start NTP client/server.
Now the work around for is that is to create user chronyd was not created during the upgrade, so the work around will require us to gaint root access to the PAN and create that user and assign it to proper group, then we will restart the chronyd service.
During inter build from 2.6 to 2.7 or higher, post-osupgrade converts ntp to chrony, by removing ntp configs and creating chrony user.
At the point where post-osupgrade writes the change to running config, startupcfg loads /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow from storedconfig.
Hence, the user never gets created and we see ntp failures after upgrade.
ACTION PLAN:
*   Cisco TAC will login to Root shell and apply the workaround for CSCvw03693<https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw03693>
*   Timezone will be changed on PAN node to Singapore (this will cause Ise application services to restart)
Let me know if you require further clarification regarding any of the points above.

If the issue is that the Standby WLC is rebooting by itself, then the secondary controller is aggressively trying to sync the IPC, but they fail to do so and results in a reboot of the secondary. Similar issues can happen in a Anchor - Foreign setup.

This behaviour is similar to multiple bugs running different images, and it should be noted that based on similar cases, 8.10.151.0 Code is not recommended for an 8540 WLC that is running HA SSO or Mobility. The BUGs in question are:

====================
high authentication latency, Profiler Queue Size Limit Reached, Radius Context Allocation failed

Last Action Plan:
=================
+++mar-9
1. ISE 3.0 patch-3
2. We have 12 nodes in the deployment.
3. 2 Admin + px-grid, 2 monitoring nodes, and 8 PSN. 
4. Currently 2 nodes are in production: hsdc-rad-nac01 and tldc-rad-nac01. All the wired and wireless authentications are handled by these 2 nodes. These 2 nodes are in different data centers.
5. Issue: On March 9th around 12 PM – 3PM, most authentications failed on the campus, both for wired and wireless. Don’t know the exact magnitude of the failure. In order to restore the customer has enabled load balancing for wireless across the 8 PSNs, but for wired still pointed to these 2 nodes specifically. 
6. During that time on the ISE dashlet we have found multiple alerts, high authentication latency, Profiler Queue Size Limit Reached, Radius Context Allocation failed. 
7. From the node hsdc-rad-nac01 tech top output, we saw that jsvc process is consuming the CPU comparatively higher than normal. And this is intermittent.
8. Platform: SNS-3655-K9 Version: 3.0.0.458 Patch: 3, Disk: 1198 GB CPU_Cores: 24 RAM: 93 GB. Resources are good.
9. User Network Topology:
SDA Network
In this network we have three different kinds of users.
- Dot1x Users
- MAB whitelisted devices
- Open port: dot1x or MAB, will fail as most devices doesn’t have the dot1x supplicant. but as it is a open port will get the IP address and able to access the network.
- Closed port: they will perform dot1x or MAB, otherwise they will get the captive portal
10. From the failed authentications, we see a lot of traffic generated for the open port users. The NAD is reauthenticating for the user and will be rejected by the ISE. For the open port user, the NAD will check if the endpoint has dot1x supplicant, as it doesn’t have it will fall back to MAB and will be rejected as it is not whitelisted. After some time, the NAD is reauthenticating the user again (authentication periodic command). 
11. collected heap-dump, thread-dump, support bundle
log files:
ise-support-bundle-pk-hsdc-rad-nac01-nusnggk-03-09-2022-18-59.tar.gpg
heap-dump-989093074024824856.hprof.gz-decoded.zip
+++mar-14
- customer reloaded the psn nodes.
- even after that, seeing high profiler queue link limit reached alarms. will check the CPU usage now.
- high authentication latency on both the nodes.
- customer states that as per the logs, between 12:00 PM and 1:30 PM both the nodes are not processing any request. need to validate this issue.

Action Plan:
1. will disable profiler persistence queue
2. will disable “ Endpoint Owner Directory” under Light data distribution 
3. will collect support bundle, heap dump, and thread dump in the call. 
+++mar-22
- BU requested the following info.
- Daily report of Radius Accounting for a Day (in CSV format)
- profiler debug on the affected PSN for 10-15 mins and collect the support bundle.
+++apr-11
- while collecting the reports, it is infinitely in ""queued"" status.
- collected the authentications, accounting reports for 2 endpoints
- customer will collect the support bundle with ""profiling"" debugs enabled on the node during/out-of-production hours to see the profiling activity.
- we see a lot of profiling activity, with radius probes, need to collect the debug logs to find the cause for the high profiling activity.","['3.0.0.458', '2.7.0.356', '3.0.0.448', '3.0.0']",3.0.0.458,SNS-3655-K9,True

Product: NA

Software Version: N/A
Router/Node Name: N/A

Problem Details: ISE (running version 3.0) API calls to Airwatch Workspace One not successful. ISE (running version 3.0) API calls to Airwatch Workspace One not successful. 1) If the attributes can't be fetched using the API call from ISE.
We need to develop some sort of integration between JAMF and ISE where they can update the endpoint information from JAMF to ISE.
We should create a RESTAPI query on the MDM which will have to update the custom Attribute value of the JAMF Endpoint to the ISE regularly.
The custom endpoint Attribute should have been already added to all endpoints by specifying those under Management -> Settings -> Endpoint Custom Attributes and using it in the Authorization policy.
However, only for JAMF, we will have the value updated by the MDM.
If the value matches, then we allow else it moves to the next policy in the list.
MDM needs to automate the script every time there is a new endpoint added to its database. So the trigger for automation is insertion.
2) ISE Application Programming Interface (API) to send requests to the MDM server to retrieve mobile endpoint information. At<https://information.at/>;; periodic intervals, ISE sends a bulk query to the MDM server to retrieve updated information for multiple endpoints. This allows ISE to reevaluate the endpoint state following successful device onboarding, MDM registration, and network authorization. All the attributes including the hostname and such are obtained every time the query is triggered.
3) ISE will send API query only at the time of her authentication realtime as these attribute values can be updated anytime post registration in the JAMF hence if we configure the Polling Interval and the reAuth query timer accordingly, we can save the endpoint details obtained from the MDM server and use the same in case the connection is dropped.

On queries on whether ISE would cache the EP attributes incase of MDM server reachability:

Suggested to create MDM reachability condition to allow the access even in the case of failure.

Time Interval For Compliance Device ReAuth Query: When an endpoint is authenticated or reauthenticated, Cisco ISE uses a cache to get the MDM variables for that endpoint. If the age of the cached value is higher than the value configured in this field, Cisco ISE sends a new device query to the MDM server to get new values. If the compliance status has changed, then Cisco ISE triggers the appropriate CoA. The valid range is from 1 to 10080 minutes. The default value is one minute.

Also have queries on MAC address spoofing. suggested to test with the ISE 3.1 where we can test using GUID instead of changining MAC address.

++ Currently, last reboot happened on Dec 21. Customer cannot share detailed topology due to confidentiality reasons
++ Need to check internally.

Jan 15:

I have reviewed the previous cases and have summarized them as follows:

++ Reference case : 692123585

•	Initially WLC would keep failing over due to peer keepalive loss.:

*rmgrMain: Sep 28 02:16:27.384: %RMGR-3-RED_HEARTBEAT_TMOUT: [SS]rmgr_sm.c:1877 Standby WLC has lost keep-alives with peer.
*rmgrMain: Sep 28 02:16:27.280: %RMGR-3-RED_HA_KA_STATS: [SS]rmgr_main.c:731 Keep-alive stats: peer RP KA loss count 5, peer RMI KA received count 0
*rmgrMain: Sep 28 02:16:27.280: %RMGR-3-RED_HA_GW_STATS: [SS]rmgr_main.c:730 Default gateway stats: ping loss count 0, ping received count 1
*rmgrMain: Sep 28 02:16:27.176: %RMGR-3-RED_HA_KA_STATS: [SS]rmgr_main.c:731 Keep-alive stats: peer RP KA 

•	Initial action plan
  1.  Adjust the heartbeat timers to allow for greater resiliency for any sort of variability on the wire.
  2.  SPAN captures at the RP ports of both of the WLCs.  This will allow us to validate that:

  -The WLCs are sending the heartbeat timers
  -The WLCs are receiving those heartbeat timers
  
  -We would need to catch the issue running the following.
Debug redundancy keepalive events
Debug redundancy keepalive errors
Debug redundancy gw-reachability events
Debug redundancy gw-reachability errors

•	The WLC’s are connected via L2 switched and the RP port on the switch was changed, but no improvement
•	BU analysis : The crash is supposed to be triggered when IAPP packet with Optional flow template with opcode 1 and 2 is received by WLC. These packets are received by WLC from AP when Netflow is enabled. WLC team had put a preventive fix for the issue using bug ID CSCvw33054 along with serviceability to capture any such packets.

•	Jan 25, 2021 - RMA of secondary WLC was raised as it was continuously rebooting, post which issues was still seen though less frequently
•	April 15, 2021 - RP port cable was changed and WLC was stable post that

++ Reference case 692123585 raised after 4 months:

•	A new pair of WLC's were setup in HASSO post which the WLC was stable

++ New case 692758235 opened post upgrade to 8.10.151.0 when the issue has started again:

•	While performing firmware upgrade, the WLC reset with the error below:

Reset reason : Peer-RMI, peer-RP and management default gateway are reachable ,(Version: 8.10.130.11)

•	There are no crash or core files generated on the controller as checked from the support bundle.

We are seeing crc errors on the switch connected to the WLC which undergoes the behavior
and with respect to replacement, only the cabling was replaced but the patch cord remained the same.
Cu had some queries with respect to the failover trigger without gateway reachability check and procedure to disable gateway check for SSO

====
CRC errors to be checked on L1 
Procedure to disable gateway reachability check:
CLI:

Note: Even for further investigation, I will not be able to escalate this case to the engineering team as you are running on version 6.4.0.12  which is end of support from engineering end.

++ I have checked the current overall health of the device and it seems fine, only one things I have noticed that we are getting the below messages which is pointing to memory issue, this issue has been already reported under the defect CSCvs42388 and the fixed version is 6.6.5.2 and workaround is to reload the device.

++ You cannot upgrade the firepower 8350 to 6.5.0.2 because the final supported version for 8350 sensor is 6.4.0 trend, hence in future if you encounter above memory issue you need to perform the cold reboot.

++ As this device is up and running from more than 300 days, hence just for safer side you can perform the cold reboot during the MW.

++ Since 30th May 2022 to till date no issue has been reported (around 60 days).","['THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', 'CISCO FIRESIGHT DEFENSE CENTER', 'CISCO FIREPOWER', '6.1.0.5.45', '6.0.1.1206', '6.2.3.10.59', '6.4.0.102', '8.3', '6.3.0.2.67', 'FPHIGH', '5.4.0.8.23', 'PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND', '6.2.3', '6.2.3.83', '6.4.0.8.28', '961', '6.4.0', '6.1.0.3.57', '6.2.3.80', 'NA-CIN_CLOSE_SW', '6.4.0.10', '6.7.0.1', 'NCS ALARMS & EVENTS', '6.4.0.9.62', '6.2.3.4', 'ASA', '6.6.5', '9.10.1', '6.6.4', '6.1', '6.2.3.6']",6.4.0,FP8300-STACK-K9,True

=====================


  *   Multiple devices compliance error state.
  *   Manual resync didn’t help and the last resync was 17 hours ago.
  *   No error noticed on provisioning logs
  *   We manually re-ran compliance as a workaround for few devices and suggested to follow the same process for other devices.
  *   TAC reviewed the logs and reached out to BU/DE
  *   During this process, all the devices were fixed without any intervention.
  *   DE’s were unable to root cause the issue with the RCA’s provided after upgrade.
  *   Obtained older RCA’s which was collected before upgrade and the DB logs which were requested by the DE
  *   DE root caused the issue with the following error which was found in the previous version.

Backup and restore:
Use cli command cmxos backup, this will do the back up in /tmp/ folder.
Copy the backup into your system using winscp or sftp server.

RESTORE:
If you want to restore the backup, transfer the backup file from the remote machine to CMX. In windows, you can simply drag and drop the files using WinSCP. On MacOS and Linux, use the following command:
scp <file_path_and_name_on_local_machine> cmxadmin@<cmx_ip_address>:/tmp
Important: Restoring Cisco CMX data must be done from a device that has the same local time. Otherwise, you will not be able to correctly access the analytics data. In addition, the data will result in errors or zero values on reports.
	To restore data, CMX needs to have free disk space 4 times the size of the backup bundle. If there is not enough space, you can try increasing the space of the VM or by running cmxos clean normal --delete command.
	Restoration process can be initiated using the cmxos restore command.
	  Restoration process requires all services to be stopped. Make sure to prepare big enough maintenance window for this process as it can take over an hour.

Please see that when the VM crashes you need to rebuild the complete CMX on the VM.","['10.6.3', '10', '3365.10.6.2.89', '8.5.130.0', '16.12.2s', '10.4.0.93', 'NA-CIN_CLOSE_SW', '10.6.2.72', 'NA - COMPONENT ONLY', '7.2.101.0', '10.6.0', '10.1.1.2', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', '10.6.1.47', '16.12.01s', '8.0.150.0', '10.2.0.213', '10.4.1.15', '10.6.2.89', '10.6.2', '10.3.1', '10.6.2.57', '8.0.140.0', '10.2.2', '8.2', '1.0']",8.0.140.0,L-MSE-PAK-N,True

Would like to know big is the capacity for shared network file ++ Is it a new installation?  yes
++ This is the clustered TMSXE, which is need to have shared folder in the network to store the config, the customer asked how much size needed in the shared folder for this, because they need to request it to their internal team. For cluster network share. 50-60 GB should be enough It will only store config, mailbox files and log file. So anything around 50 GB should enough.

++ This is a new implementation.
++ The PCs are connected to the two Cat9300 Stacks.

++ There is an IBM Device connected to the 1st 9300 Stack.
     It acts as the DHCP Server for VLAN:401
      It is connected on port Gi1/0/1 & Gi1/0/48
++ The Default Gateway of the PCs in VLAN:401 is the IBM Device : 137.132.33.1
++ If a PC from the 1st Stack wants to reach the Internet, then the traffic comes to this IBM Device to port Gi1/0/1 (VLAN:401).
      Then the IBM Device routes this to VLAN:411 and sends it back on port Gi1/0/48, and the Switch sends it to the uplink Core Switch.
      The PCs from the 2nd Stack act in an exact same manner. If they have to reach the internet, then they traverse the Core Switch to the 1st Stack, goes to Gi1/0/1 to the IBM Device.
      And the IBM device routes it to VLAN:411 and sends it back on Gi1/0/48, towards the uplink Core Switch.
++ If a PC from 1st Stack wants to talk to another PC from the 2nd Stack, then the traffic directly goes from the PC1  1st Stack  Core Switch  2nd Stack  PC2
++ The problem that is happening in this scenario is that if a PC from the 1st Stack wants to reach the internet (ping 8.8.8.8 from the PC is being used for testing), then it intermittently works.","['16.12.04', 'NA - COMPONENT ONLY', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', 'NA - RMA', '3.2.3o', '15.0.2', '16.06.07', '16.12.03s', '1.0', '16.06.08', '16.12.1s', '17.03.05', '16.9.5', '16.12.01s', 'PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND', '16.3.5', '16.12.3s', '16.09.02', '16.12.3a', '17.6.4']",16.12.3s,C9300-48U-A,True

Problem Details: 1) Is it possible to monitor the performance of vCMX such as CPU, Memory, Disk usage by using Solarwinds or Cisco Prime Infra? We are using Solarwinds/PI to monitor the health of other cisco devices such as switches/ISEs. Solarwinds/PI monitor those devices by using snmp polling/traps.

2) As per the cisco document, CMX can display Alerts (in gui System > Alerts page) and send out Alert Emails. We want to know the threshold values of Waring, Minor, Major, and Critical Alerts for CPU, Memory, Disk, Swap usage.

3) Will CMX send out alert email if a process's CPU usage exceed 100%? For example, java process 2970 reached 512.5% and java process 18466 reached 206.2% when checking with top command. Refer to below top output. In this kind of situation, will cmx send out alert emails?

When java process 2970's CPU usage reached 512.5%, in GUI System Dashboard, CPU usage was shown as about 20%, meaning 80% CPU is free to use. Why did CMX not using the free 80% of CPU for java process 2970 at the time of that process reached 512.5% CPU usage?

Problem Details: wireless client getting IP address is different from the IP address range configure on DNAC wireless client getting IP address is different from the IP address range configure on DNAC Thank you for sharing your confirmation for closure of this case for now.

Case Summary :

Issue : Wireless clients getting incorrect IP from traditional setup IP pool while roaming.

DNAC : 1.3.3.7
WLC :8540
Version : 8.10.130.11

Issue 1 : Clients getting IP address from incorrect IP pool and in 5/10 seconds changes back to correct IP address.

We observed multiple client getting IP address allocated from incorrect (172.17.x.x. and 172.23.x.x) subnet and in next 5/10 seconds changes back to correct IP address pool.

Conclusion : When a client connected on traditional AP moves/roams to SDA/fabric AP, it takes around 10-15 seconds for new client IP to be update in all SDA. During this period the client remains on the traditional IP address registered in WLC.

Issue 2 : Client getting IP address from incorrect IP pool while roaming between SDA fabric SSID’s

For this concern/issue we need to do live testing by connecting a client to fabric (SDA) SSID and make it roam to another fabric (SDA) SSID in same network.

Next plan of action :
-Need to check the initial IP address assigned to client on first fabric (SDA) SSID.
-While roaming between AP’s need to check if at any time the IP address of the client changes to traditional IP subnet.
-Check what is causing/triggering the IP address change for clients while roaming.
-Validate the IP address of client after roaming to different AP/fabric (SDA) SSID.

Currently as there is government restrictions, you are not allowed to go to site for testing.

Closing with customer confirmation and approval.","['2.2.2.9', '2.1.2.7', '16.12.01s', '4.0.4b', 'PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND', '17.3.3', '1.3.3.9', '17.3.4a', '1.3.3.7', '2.2.3.6', '2.2.2.3', '2.1.2.0']",1.3.3.7,DN2-HW-APL-XL,True

Problem Details: Cassandra Service stopped and there is huge number of open files by process nmsplb Cassandra Service stopped and there is huge number of open files by process nmsplb [1] Initially when logged in to CMX we saw the Cassandra service stopped.

[2] Restarted the services to bring it up.

[3] Observed the below message related to “No Space left on device” in the logs.

[cid:image001.png@01D778E5.C133CB80]


[4] As mentioned in the guide, once the disk usage reaches 85% the services begin to stop.

[5] We have dug in to the RCA and observed that it was caused because of the file descriptors issue.

[6] Even though the analytics was disabled, the location was still trying to contact resulting in a huge log files around 200GB being accumulated with only one line stored in the logs “Too many open files”

[7] Once the services were restarted, the open files got cleared and hence slowly the logs got rolled over and the utilization became normal.

[8] We have installed the Analytics patch as a fix for the issue. Permanent fix present in 10.6.3 MR1 yet to be released.

[9] Bug for tracking the issue:- https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvt21966

I will proceed to close the case since the issue has been identified and fix provided by the patch.","['10.6.3', '10', '3365.10.6.2.89', '8.5.130.0', '16.12.2s', '10.4.0.93', 'NA-CIN_CLOSE_SW', '10.6.2.72', 'NA - COMPONENT ONLY', '7.2.101.0', '10.6.0', '10.1.1.2', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', '10.6.1.47', '16.12.01s', '8.0.150.0', '10.2.0.213', '10.4.1.15', '10.6.2.89', '10.6.2', '10.3.1', '10.6.2.57', '8.0.140.0', '10.2.2', '8.2', '1.0']",10.6.0,L-MSE-PAK-N,True

++ As per the show tech, we can see the below logs messages are continuously generating on the switch, which is due to low memory conditions on the switch.

++ As per the show tech, I can see that total system memory is available 3 GB and system is using above 2.5 GB memory, there is only near about 400 MB system memory remaining on the switch.
      This can be impacting the performance of the switch and will might cause unexpected reload in future.

Action Plan :
++ The previous Engineer checked the show tech file and saw that there were some alarms related to memory leakage.
++ We could see this switch is running on 16.03.06 which is a bit old IOS code and vulnerable to memory leakage.
++ You can plan IOS upgrade to fix the memory leakage problem.
++ As per below link : https://software.cisco.com/download/home/284850616/type/282046477/release/Fuji-16.9.4?catid=268438038
     16.9.4 is latest IOS codes for this platform.
      If you don’t want to install Smart Licensing, then 16.6.7 would be the recommended code.
++ If you want to particularly check for which process is taking up the utilization before upgrade, we can do that.
++ We would recommend you to grab following CLI outputs from the suspicious switch, every 2-3 hours for 2 day and send across.

Problem Details: this case is opened on behalf of customer by HTOM eugan@cisco.com

Hi team,
This case is related to SR 689297100.  One of the issues in the SR is stale client records in CMX, when a client roams from APs connected to different CMX.  Customer is using CMX data for COVID-19 contact tracing and is using API calls to obtain client data from CMX.  These stale records are causing the application to receive the stale and current record.

Customer would like to understand which field in CMX can be reliably used to determine which record is current or stale.  Possible fields could be ""Last Seen"" or ""Timestamp"", but would require explanation on where and how these fields are obtained or calculated.  Thanks this case is opened on behalf of customer by HTOM eugan@cisco.com

 One of our customers had 2 ASA 5506 deployed in June 2021.

A few days ago, one ASA 5506 was unable to ping out to any external ip address (including direct neighbour ips). For example, if we were to ping 4.2.2.1, we would get:
AESL-CD-ASA01-OT# ping 4.2.2.1
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 4.2.2.1, timeout is         2 seconds:
?????
Success rate is 0 percent (0/5)

Since the timeout was 2seconds per ping, we expected the command to complete in about 10seconds, with 2 seconds interval, however the entire command was completed in about 0.5s. We expect that is able to ping as it was previously configured as such.

We also found that although the ASA is unable to ping out to 4.2.2.1, it somehow is able to to traceroute out:

Problem Details: DNAC version is 1.3.3.7 and most of our Fabric edge switches are running on version 16.12.4.
On some of the switches DNAC provisions the ACL_WEBAUTH_REDIRECT acl correctly while on some switches, some of the ACL entries are missing. 
If we manually add the ACL correctly, DNAC seems to reset the ACL again wrongly.

Problem Details: Hi TAC team,

Our customer has logged a crash on their ASA FW and have sent over the crashinfo logs.

Kindly assist us in going through the logs and finding the cause of the crash

Thank you. Hi TAC team,

Our customer has logged a crash on their ASA FW and have sent over the crashinfo logs.

Kindly assist us in going through the logs and finding the cause of the crash

Thank you. Based on the show tech, I can see that CPU, memory are good. All the interfaces are up. All processes are running fine.
CPU utilization for 5 seconds = 15%; 1 minute: 12%; 5 minutes: 12%
Free memory:       11955556008 bytes (83%)
 
Your ASA doesn’t have coredump file ‘coredumpfsys’ in its flash.
 
After examining the crashinfo,  I understand your device running ASA 9.14(2)15 crashed on 2021-09-06 due to bug CSCvy48159 https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvy48159  - ASA Traceback & reload on process name Lina due to memory header validation.
 
Workaround-
Disabling threat detection at the CLI will prevent this crash, but doing so may trigger a second crash (also covered under this defect ID). Therefore the following is recommended:

For Standalone setups:
> Save the config of the device (do not perform any further changes until all steps below described are followed)
> Retrieve startup config from affected device
> Remove ""threat-detection"" lines from retrieved file
> Upload new file to flash of device
> Copy the config from the file to the startup config: 
copy flash:/ startup-config
> Reload the device
 
Permanent fix-
You can upgrade the device to version 9.14.3 which is a known fixed release as per the bug page.","['6.0.0.1005', 'FPHIGH', '964.3', '9.14.2.15', 'CISCO FIREPOWER', 'ASA', '9.8.4.7', '9.8.3', '9.12.4', '9.8.1', '9.14.3', '9.8.2', '9.14.2.4']",9.14.2.15,FPR2130-ASA-K9,True

Problem Details: We have experienced a issue yesterday on SIP traffic
1.	We have configured ACL to allow SIP (udp5060) traffic between set of clients and servers (which is acl line 1001)
2.	We tried to implement deny ACL for SIP traffic at the bottom of rule base i.e after all permit ACL (which is acl line 2000)
The traffic suppose to getting allowed in permit ACL itself but it was getting denied at newly implemented deny acl.

Before there was IP based permit ACL which we removed before to implement deny ACL.

Note: I have taken IP details and screenshot of ACL and its line number during the issue time. Lets have a call to understand the problem and I can explain the concern with available information. We have experienced a issue yesterday on SIP traffic

Before there was IP based permit ACL which we removed before to implement deny ACL.

Note: I have taken IP details and screenshot of ACL and its line number during the issue time. Lets have a call to understand the problem and I can explain the concern with available information. You informed that you are using FPR9k running ASA image.
You have configured an ACL to allow SIP traffic between specific hosts but when you are initiating traffic it is getting blocked due to the deny rule.

Allow rule:

access-list ServerfarmZone line 1013 extended permit ip object-group 95012_SFB_AC-VoiceGW object-group 95003_SFB_CIC_SVRs log informational interval 300

Deny rule:

access-list ServerfarmZone line 2257 extended deny ip object-group 95041_SFB_SVRF_Servers any log informational interval 300

We found that the traffic which is getting denied is from source (172.18.22.133) and destination (172.18.173.127).

We checked the destination object-group and we found that the ip address is incorrectly configured due to which it is getting denied.

Problem Details: why unwanted and unrelated traffic is passing thru this “Whitelist URL” rule  . Need assistance for troubleshoot why unwanted and unrelated traffic is passing thru this “Whitelist URL” rule  . Need assistance for troubleshoot Issue 1:
The initial issue was reported with all the traffic from a particular subnet was matching an incorrect rule and getting permitted through the box.

Here is the detailed analysis of the issue:


  1.  The rule which is created to allow DNS & HTTP based app matching URL is named “Whitelist URL” on FMC, when this is pushed to the sensor the corresponding rule is id as shown as below:

[cid:image001.png@01D47751.71B80A50]



  1.  The rule id 268486661 is how the sensors see the rule where it is expanded to match the parameters that are configured.
  2.  Now, in case of 7000 and 8000 series sensor, we have a concept of rule-promotion to hardware. In this we promote the rules from the software to hardware for faster processing if the same rule is being triggered multiple times in order to perform faster lookup.
  3.  The hardware rules are saved in “Netronome” hardware-based ASIC.
  4.  The rule in the hardware are shown below:

[cid:image002.png@01D47751.71B80A50]



  1.  The version of netronome firmware is also dependent on the firmware that is running on sensor.
  2.  The firmware version of netronome is our case here on affected device is:

[cid:image003.png@01D47751.71B80A50]



  1.  Because of a known issue in the way hardware rules are evaluated by netronome, there is defect where the hardware promoted rule are not enforced correctly because of which most of the traffic matching the subnet or any one parameter is evaluated against the same rule.
  2.  The issue is fixed in the higher version of netronome version which is 4.2 Build 935
  3.  We need to have the version upgraded to the fixed release so that we do not encounter the same problem.
  4.  The fix is available in all releases documented in: https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvh07446/?reffering_site=dumpcr


Issue 2: Incorrect rule being generated for traffic which is not supposed to hit the rule

++ The log excerpts are on the debug which we collected for a specific IP address that was incorrectly matching the “Whitelist URL” rule.

[cid:image001.png@01D4C068.E97AADD0]


++ Now, if we look at this specific URL  which is being accessed is some URL which is not hoghimwei.com
++ The second rule which is “Whitelist URL” which is configured to match specific URL. ( The logging is enabled at the end of the connection for this)

++ Here we see the rule evaluation putting this into pending state for this traffic. (This makes sense because the URL has not yet been extracted and snort is not able to match it)
++ If you look at the last line, we see the URL has been extracted while the rule is still pending evaluation and we do a URL SI lookup to understand if it has to be blocked.

++ The traffic eventually hits the default matching rule and gets permitted/denied based on what is configured.
++ If we observe a little more carefully to track this connection is the source port that is being used.

  1.  63461
  2.  63462

++ This is important for the analysis which is about to follow:

  1.  This specific connection as shown earlier has put the “Whitelist URL” into the rule pending state because we were not able to extract the URL till this stage.
  2.  However, after the rule has been pushed to pending state we see the URL being extracted.
  3.  Now if we look at the excerpt below:

[cid:image002.png@01D4C068.E97AADD0]


The connection which had put the rule “whitelist URL” gets an end of flow event from the hardware indicating that the connection has been completed. What this does is, since the “Whitelist URL” was in pending state with the action set as log at the end of connection will generate an connection event.

Solution for the same:
==================


  1.  Change the logging of the “Whitelist URL” rule to start of the connection.
  2.  The brightcloud category for the URL is updated to “Educational Institution” and use of category based rule should also solve the problem.

In existing scenario there is no security bypass which is happening and it is purely logging concern.","['ASA', 'FPHIGH', 'CISCO FIREPOWER', '6.2.3.5', '6.2.3', '6.2', 'CISCO FIRESIGHT DEFENSE CENTER']",6.2,FP8300-STACK,True

You can close the case for now, since the only workaround is to reload the AP. We are planning to upgrade the OS soon and test the behavior after that, if we find the issue we shall open another case reoffering this case.

Hello Biswajit

As per our last discussion on call, we are hitting the bug, CSCvh21912<https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvh21912/?reffering_site=dumpcr>.
In order to fix the issue, the AP was rebooted. Generally, the issue shouldn’t recur on the AP.

Please note the bug is not yet fixed and we’d need to install the debug image on the APs for further isolation of the issue.
However, the debug image is currently not available on 8.3 version.
If you are facing this issue consistently, I can check with BU if they can provide us with the debug image on the same code.

Let me know on how can we proceed further.

Hello Biswajit

This is Anand from Cisco CX-Wireless team. I have accepted the ownership of this case and will assist you further with this SR.
From the problem description, I understand that the AP is broadcasting disabled WLANs.

I also see that the WLC is currently running on 8.3.143.0 version. Moreover, the affected AP is a 2802 AP.
The issue is due to the defect, CSCvh21912<https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvh21912/?reffering_site=dumpcr>.
However, the bug is still under investigation and we are waiting for more data to isolate the issue further.
As a workaround, you may reboot the AP and issue should not be seen again on the same.

Let me know if you have any queries.

My contact details and shift timings are included for your reference. In case you need immediate assistance on this case outside my shift hours you can always contact TAC frontline (link provided below) to request for an available engineer.

You'll have to repeat above process for each VRF separately.
Once context is associated with a VRF you can collect a lot of information using MIBs which are normally don't support VRFs natively. Not all MIBs are context aware, though, bgpPeerState being an example.

====================
TrustSec SXP Mappings not getting populated

Troubleshooting/ Steps taken:
===========
1.	ISE 3.0p3. 
2.	New requirement, ASA integration with ISE for SXP mappings. You enabled SXP over 2 nodes.
3.	Issue: All SXP mappings page on ISE is not populating with the session information. 
4.	We checked the SXP settings and “store radius sessions” option is enabled, still we are seeing as “No Data Found” on the All SXP mappings page. 
5.	We checked the ISE CLI and found that the service is initialising on both the nodes (where SXP is enabled)
6.	Suspecting the following bug: https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe54318 (there is no fix for the bug as of now). 
7.	As discussed, enabling SXP on one node is sufficient.
You recently upgraded the patch to patch-7.
We checked the ISE and the ASA and the configuration looks good.
We checked the ASA and SXP sessions are being correctly learned on the ASA.
Issue is resolved.

 cdp enable So basically we discussed how the MPLS label will impact the MTU. 
 
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6000-series-switches/24048-148.html 
 
this is the only document that I found that supports this. Although this is for the catalyst switches , it’s applicable for all MPLS deployment. 
 
 
 
This is applicable for both Jumbo Frames and Regular frames. 
 
•	We have to set the MPLS MTU to 9212 which is the maximum under the interface where the MPLS traffic is passing. 
•	It depends on what other protocol customer is running. According to that there will overhead on the MTU. Traffic Engineering, FRR and L2 VPN will add more labels hence will require more MTU size.","['17.03.04a', '16.03.05b', '1.0', '16.12.1s']",1.0,ASR1009-X,False

It was great discussion on how Portscan Detection is working in terms of event generation.
As explained, For events generated by the portscan connection detector, the protocol number is set to 255.
Because portscan does not have a specific protocol associated with it by default, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) does not have a protocol number assigned to it.
IANA designates 255 as a reserved number, so that number is used in portscan events to indicate that there is not an associated protocol for the event.

This is to inform you that I have taken ownership of the ticket.
You can find my contact info and timings in my signature.
I understand that you need to know the impact of enabling some signatures that you have mentioned on case.
You can check each signature details on FMC and find out few parameters based on which impact can be more clear.
Please note the question is very subjective and there is no clear/direct answer to it.
Each signature has its own overhead and based on the type of traffic that is handled by device along with services enabled, performance of device can be impacted.
There is no parameter of impact as such.
Further, following can be checked
>if the signature is enabled by default in any of system provided intrusion policy or no.
>Rule overhead in each signature.

As there are some script would run but we should have the pre-requirement which is 1TB.
As its expected to  see some related services not working as expected when we are running out of the requirement.
For now I would suggest to go with following:
1-      Add more space here to CSM.
2-      Purge the data , as this would be a workaround not a permeant solution so if we need to solve this issue permanently we need to increase the disk here.

As you can see in the above details, the reference article for the firepower snort signature is the same as the one being referenced by the end customer.
Which means, that the firepower snort signature is covering all the aspects of the Trojan.
Earlier I had mentioned only one specific signatures, but here are the details for all the signature which covers all the aspects of the signature.
Also, the initial data mentioned in the case represents the variation in snort id, which act like an improvisation to avoid false positives, it doesn't mention anywhere that there is a variation in the malware.
Concluding, the snort signature available on firepower systems is covering the malware in every aspect and there is no need of an custom signature.

708,694483274,emailin,"Dear Elven,
In an effort to resolve your case faster it may be necessary to collect some diagnostic data from your environment.
Based on the problem statement you provided, below are a few pieces of data that would help speed the resolution and the steps to collect them:
*** Troubleshoot File ***
* Connect to the device using SSH
* Issue the command expert, skip this step for FMC version 6.4.x and earlier
* Issue the command sudo su
* When prompted for the password, enter your password.
* For FMC 6.4 or FTD 6.7 and later issue the command
curl -s -S https://cxd.cisco.com/public/ctfr/firepower.py | python - -c 694483274 -t Ggc3PkaldpvtbFmM --auto-upload &
* For FMC 6.3 or FTD 6.6 and earlier issue the command
curl -k -s -S https://cxd.cisco.com/public/ctfr/firepower.py | python - -c 694483274 -t Ggc3PkaldpvtbFmM --auto-upload &
If you experience failures with this command or want to learn more about this program (including why you are receiving this e-mail) - please refer to https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/secure-firewall-threat-defense/218198-understand-the-first-responder-program.html
If you use the -k switch, you should confirm that cxd.cisco.com resolves to 72.163.14.108 or 173.37.151.76.
Furthermore, it is recommended to validate the SHA checksum of the file by running curl -s -k https://cxd.cisco.com/public/ctfr/firepower.py | shasum which should output 2ae29968e54b852f155a5b44e92cf1e750bafd24.

Also you can set a cron job as well for the same to avoid any further issues due to the process.
For each stack member that is experiencing the ActionQueueScrape memory leak.
As root, first view the existing cron jobs by running (lower-case L after the minus sign): crontab -l
If the cron to restart ActionQueueScrape is not already present, open crontab for editing (crontab -e) and add the following line (for instance, if you want to run the cron daily at 04:00 UTC, you can use the following or customize it according to your need):
0 4 * * * /usr/local/sf/bin/pmtool restartbyid ActionQueueScrape
Verify the cron job is now scheduled by running again: crontab -l
To make sure the cron is doing what it's supposed to do, check the /var/log/top.log file periodically, and you should see the pid of ActionQueueScrape change each time after it is restarted by the cron job.
Alternatively, you can run the following before the cron is scheduled to run to get the pid of ActionQueueScrape:
pmtool status | egrep '^ActionQueueScrape.*Running.*[0-9]+$' | awk '{print $5}'
Run this again after the cron job has run and it should give you a different pid for ActionQueueScrape, indicating that it has been restarted.

Problem Details: Hi Cisco TAC,

We have troubleshooted this CPU Spike issue at C6807-XL switch with the mentioned case number( SR688275557).

But Engineer already cloesed the case .So, now we want to reopen the case for this issue.

As per checked with TAC engineer last time, the issue was happened due to one of the multicast process(cmfib) .

This process is responsible for updating multicast entries on the switch.

Now want to know the capacity of the Catalyst 6807XL on handling the multicast traffic on control plane and data plane.

I was stuck on another escalation call.
When I joined this ticket to provide assistance, the status was pending workaround to the bug ID provided by the previous engineer.
The successful workaround that was performed was in effort to remedy the symptoms mentioned in CSCvu66119<https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu66119>.
As mentioned in the bug, when an FMC running software 6.4.0-6.6.0 is managing legacy hardware (FS 7000,8000) deployed with pure URL only, access controls rules – there is the potential for the URL rules to circumvent and promote themselves above other rules in the access control policy.
These symptoms and conditions match what happened during the downtime event that was experienced.
During this event, the URL access control rules promoted themselves above other allow rules, preventing legitimate traffic from traversing the appliance.
The successful workaround performed on call for this issue, was to add additional application specific parameter to the rule (such as http/https), as mentioned in the bug.
This changed the rules in question from pure URL rules, to URL w/ app parameters.
To avoid this issue with any future rule updates, we should either apply additional conditions to URL rules as described or update the software of the FMC to 6.6.1 or later as mentioned in bug.
Please do update me with any questions, concerns, or thoughts.

We can see that from the Switch logs that box crashed due to Software issue.
Which was triggered due to CDP protocol reset known as cdp hap reset.
And a core file was saved, I was able to decode the core file and the traces matched a very old bug which was published external and was filled in the year 2012.
The Support for the code is no longer available, as BU recommended to move to higher levels of code.
Thus, please consider upgrading the box to fixed code version 6.0.2.A.1.1 or up on any version of 6.0.2.

Problem Details: ISE 2.3  RADIUS Accounting - Interim update - Endpoint IP address and MAC address missing ISE 2.3  RADIUS Accounting - Interim update - Endpoint IP address and MAC address missing As discussed :


  1.  It is expected to see some Accounting Start packets not having an IP address as accounting start packets are sent as soon as the user is authenticated irrespective of whether or not the user got an IP address. It so can happen that the user may get an IP address after a second or so and not immediately after the authentication and in such cases, the accounting start may not have an IP address.
  2.  It sometimes can so happen that the interim updates may also miss an IP address. This happens when the DHCP lease time expires and the end device has to renew its lease or when the endpoint moves from one AP to another AP and mistakes it for a network change and refreshes IP etc.
  3.  Having said point number 2. Only one 2 such interim updates per user per endpoint can be expected. Eventually that user/endpoint should get an IP address and should be available in the subsequent interim updates. It cannot happen that such an endpoint doesn’t get an IP for the entire day if it still has an active session and connected to the network.

Also, Accounting is not a 100% full proof method to take any security measures in a network and one should not rely solely on that for the above mentioned reasons and also especially because of the fact that these syslogs are sent over an unsecure medium to start with and anyone can tamper with them. Anyways, that is for the customer to decide.","['2.4.0', '2.1.0']",2.4.0,SNS-3595-K9,False

As rule profiling findings have been returned and this case does not meet the criteria for a P1 (network currently down, both customer and TAC on the phone 24/7) I will lower severity to P2.
Action plan: please put the stack in inline-tap mode and let us know when we can schedule a session to collect a new set of rule profiling and flow profiling data during heavy traffic hours.
The flow profiling data in particular will give us a clearer understanding of what traffic exists on the network.
Having the stack in inline-tap and passing traffic will also let us monitor performance to see if the heavy Snort CPU usage and dropped packets return.","['ASA', 'CISCO FIREPOWER', 'FSIGHT', '6.1.0.3.57', '9.6.1']",CISCO FIREPOWER,FS4000-K9,False

...
How frequently those fields are updated.swlyta lastSeen not updated.json.
This client is connected for 24461 secs, 6.79 hrs, shown in wlc, but in cmx api, it was showing ""lastSeen"": ""2020-06-27T06:01:02.757+0800"". We run the query in cmx about [27-Jun-20 12:47:43 PM] but lastSeen is showing 6am.
During this writing, I queried cmx again but lastSeen time remain the same at 6am, refer to 2020-06-27_131754.jpg and it was taken at 13:17:54.
Can we consider this as fresh client record in cmx

2) ""timestamp"": 1593208862757,..

4) ""confidenceFactor"": 32,


How to interpret timestamp and notificationTime, and their value?

What is confidenceFactor? 


Is there any other fields that we can use for in comparing v3 active client records of the same user ?
Application need to get the client’s location in the most updated/latest client records.


All these questions are related to issue#2 of SR 689297100 : wireless client cannot find in CMX.

Issue #2 – stale record in cmx (same client record appeared in two cmx showing connected to two different ap, but one is stale record)","['10.6.3', '10', '3365.10.6.2.89', '8.5.130.0', '16.12.2s', '10.4.0.93', 'NA-CIN_CLOSE_SW', '10.6.2.72', 'NA - COMPONENT ONLY', '7.2.101.0', '10.6.0', '10.1.1.2', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', '10.6.1.47', '16.12.01s', '8.0.150.0', '10.2.0.213', '10.4.1.15', '10.6.2.89', '10.6.2', '10.3.1', '10.6.2.57', '8.0.140.0', '10.2.2', '8.2', '1.0']",10.6.3,L-MSE-PAK-N,False

Here’s the information on the defect:
Symptom:
Cat9300 switch controlled by DNAC might reboot unexpectedly when processing ARP packet.
In the crashinfo file generated for the crash we see:

UNIX-EXT-SIGNAL: Segmentation fault(11), Process = ARP Snoop

Conditions:
The issue was seen on Catalyst 9300 in the SDA environment while processing the ARP packet that is sent to the CPU.

Workaround:
unknown yet

Without a workaround present for the version you’re running, it seems that to avoid the same crash happening again, it’s feasible to consider an upgrade of the IOS-XE version to 17.3.2a, which has the fix built-in for this defect.",['16.12.04'],16.12.04,C9300-48U,False

For round robin for a PAT pool
If a host has an existing connection, then subsequent connections from that host will use the same PAT IP address if ports are available.
However, this ""stickiness"" does not survive a failover.
If the device fails over, then subsequent connections from a host might not use the initial IP address.
Round robin, especially when combined with extended PAT, can consume a large amount of memory.
Because NAT pools are created for every mapped protocol/IP address/port range, round robin results in a large number of concurrent NAT pools, which use memory.
Extended PAT results in an even larger number of concurrent NAT pools.","['6.4.0.102', 'CISCO FIREPOWER', '6.1.0.3.57', 'ASA', '6.2.3.15.38', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', '6.2.3.80', '6.2.3.83', '6.5.0.1', '6.4.0', '6.3.0']",THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW,FPR9K-SM-24,False

Understand normally we configure same VRRP ID in different interfaces as Virtual mac-address will based on VRRP ID.  Is there any way to configured single VRRP ID in different Sub-interfaces but on same main interfaces.

The objective is to achieved configuration like below :

as we got an error semantic as below while configured same VRRP ID : 

!! SEMANTIC ERRORS: This configuration was rejected by 
!! the system due to semantic errors. The individual 
!! errors with each failed configuration command can be

Thank You. Problem Description
=====================
Customer trying to configure same VRRP group ID on different subinterface from same main interface .
“'vrrp' detected the 'warning' condition 'Virtual MAC already in use on this port'”

Business Impact
===============
No impact confirmed

Analysis
=========
The error “!% 'vrrp' detected the 'warning' condition 'Virtual MAC already in use on this port'’ is legitimate. This comes from a parser when you try to commit, a check on existing VMACs is performed and is we find duplicate config rejected.

In a router running IOS-XR, configuring the same virtual router id(VRID) on multiple sub-interfaces of the same physical interfaces is NOT supported for HSRP/ VRRP . We need to use different virtual router id for the different sub-interfaces of same physical interface

This has been documented on DDTS CSCed75140
https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCed75140

From what I am checking this is a hw limitation and I do not see it fixed on newer releases. Same virtual router id means that they use the same virtual MAC address (as this is derived from the virtual router ID). Problem description part of this documentation bug explains mac filtering is not supported as it can cause network down situations.",['7.1.2'],7.1.2,ASR-9006-SYS,False

Used remove_peers.pl to remove the entry from 118
>> Changed the IP address of the sensor to 172.18.16.119 and then the registration was complete
>> Performed the synchronization between the FMCs and the device now showed up in both devices.
>> The device was experiencing policy deployment failures.
Removed the policies with URL filtering rules since there were no URL licenses available on the FMC and then the policy apply was successful.
>> Then the stack for the device was created
>> Health status for the device was not showing as green.
Resolution: The changed IP causing the device to register was due to the fact that there was a stale entry for the IP address 172.18.16.125 where it was still being referenced to a different device so the Primary FMC would not see it as listening for registration.
This was not a Firepower issue but an issue with the devices inline with the management ports on the devices.
Like we discussed I will be closing this case.

Problem Details: Hi there,

I am using SIP on Cisco IP Phone 7911G. However, I realized that the packets need to pass through the router when two phones communicate. Moreover, the RTP packets also pass through the router.

How can I configure it in such a way that the phones direct the SIP packets to each other without passing through the router? 

To my knowledge, for SIP, once the INVITE and OK messages are exchanged, the proxy server, which in my case is the router, will not be required anymore. However, even after the messages are sent, all SIP and RTP packets still pass through the router.

Hi Anurag,

As discussed in call we can proceed with the command as it was already considered by Cisco in the TAC case as the last option to arrest the issue at switch processor.

mls rate-limit multicast ipv6 mld 10 1

Also we have discussed that we can enable below command to control ARP broadcast.

mls rate-limit unicast cef glean 20000 60

Let me discuss the same with NUS SME and plan the action for today.

Hello Soon Yee
I am glad to hear that the issue is resolved and everything is working fine.
Here is a quick summary of the case :
Problem Description:
====================
Unable to access MSE server
Resolution :
============
From the command ""service msed status"" we were able to see that the MSE services were not running so we used the command ""service msed start"" and everything came back up as expected.
As per our discussion on the phone, I will go ahead and close this SR 682079901.
It has been an absolute pleasure working with you and, thank you for continuing to choose Cisco.
For any future assistance, you may contact TAC via your local TAC toll free number.","['AIR-MSE', '8.0.130.0', 'WLC MGMT/ERROR MSG']",AIR-MSE,AIR-MSE-3310-K9,False

On checking the Swim Service Logs , I don’t see any exceptions happening during the mentioned time which would be an expected behaviour here as if there were any exceptions that had occurred , the Task may have denoted the same. The Task service logs as well haven’t been notified about any error since no exceptions were recorded in the Swim service.
 
Also from the Switch logs, we did see the Distribution was successful and the activation was triggered as well which initiated a reboot on the Device post which the issue had happened.
 
Would it be possible for you to help me understand the exact failure that happened on the Switch after the reload ?
 
Was the Switch able to come up automatically with the updated image or did we have to remove it from the stack and make any changes ?
 
Additionally I am also involving an expert from C9300 Team to check the Tech support logs of the switch which you have shared to understand the perspective from the Switch better with respect to its communication with DNAC
 
Additionally I am also reviewing few relevant service logs in DNAC which could prove the possibility that the DNAC has either been made aware of one of the Switch Stack failures or if there was a gap in communication between the devices.","['2.3.3.6', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', '2.2.2.9']",2.3.3.6,DN2-HW-APL,False

Action Plan --> We went on WebEx and worked on the issue.
We found that the traffic was getting blocked by a particular signature,
44727  --> PROTOCOL-SNMP Cisco Wireless LAN Controller cldcClientTable OID memory leak attempt
The CVE ID for this is 2017-12278.
As per that sensor is detecting more than 50 packets in 5 seconds and thus it is getting triggered.
The possible steps are :
a)       Slow down the traffic from the source itself so that sensor does not detect it as DOS.
b)      Change the signature setting to ""event only"" however this is a workaround.
Let me know if you have any further query.","['THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', 'CISCO FIREPOWER', '6.2.2.1.73', 'CISCO FIRESIGHT DEFENSE CENTER', '15454.6', '6.1.0.3.57', '6.2.0.362', 'NA-CIN_CLOSE_SW', 'FPHIGH', '6.7.0.3', '6.2.3.1.43', '7.2.0.1.12', 'ASA', '8.3', '15.2.2', '6.2.3.83', '6.4.0']",8.3,FS4000-K9,False

Thanks for the email and apologies for the delays.
Please confirm you ran this command on both the primary and Secondary.
We are looking at two particular possible issues.
We could be running into the  issue where the Eorevision store table has not been optimized and the size could be surpassing 500MB
This behaviour is documented by Bug  CSCvd62177
https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvd62177/
To fix this issue we will optimise the table.

Regarding the core files we will need all of them however we would like to confirm that this issue is occurring since 17th May (as the cores are for the same  day).
If yes, then we would need all the core files attached to the case.

Could you please share the document with us to configure Port Security and Strome Control in Edge Switches.

I can see that your /OPT partition is 100% filled with the ACS View logs database.
We will need to delete the ACS View database to clear the space.
The logs from the ACS View database will be deleted.
The only way to prevent them is to copy the logs database manually to an external storage resource.
In case the logs need to be reviewed the database would need to be restored on a ACS Virtual machine created solely for this purpose.
If you do not need to preserve the logs, then you can try to clear the database by yourself with the following steps:
1.
Login to the log collector ACS with SSH.
2.
Enter ACS application configuration mode:
ACSC2/admin# acs-config
Escape character is CNTL/D.
Username: acsadmin (ACS GUI username)
Password:
ACSC2/acsadmin(config-acs)#
3.
Replace the logs database with an empty one:
ACSC2/acsadmin(config-acs)# acsview replace-cleandb
Please note that the ACS services on the log collector will be stopped and the process will take significant amount of time.
If you prefer to do this together we can have a webex at 19:00 Singapore Time (13:00 GMT+2) or tomorrow morning around 14:30 Singapore time.
Please note that this issue is separate issue then the replication problem.
Therefore a separate case should be raised for that problem.
On an exceptional basic I can offer you help with clearing the database.
Perhaps it would be better for you to have an engineer from the APAC time zone to assist you tomorrow morning.
In that case please let me know the preferred time to be contacted and I will create a case for you and schedule the dispatch of it.
Alternatively please do not hesitate to open a new case for this problem tomorrow morning of your time.
