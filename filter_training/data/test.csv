Note :
**** IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU RETURN ONLY THE PART ORDERED.****
For return shipments, only ship back the same parts that are received.
Please do not ship back any needed accessories such as cables, rack mounts,
manuals, CD's.
These items are only shipped with original shipments not with

Also, for modular replacements, all non-faulty
components will need to be swapped from the old device to the replacement
device (WICs; NMs; PAs; Memory; any onboard modules like PVDMs or AIM
modules, etc).
It's very important that the contract be updated with the replacement serial
numbers.
Receipt of returned product triggers our system to update old
serial number to new serial number automatically.
Please ensure that you
leave 5 days from the Cisco date of receipt of the returned product to allow
our processes/systems to update the contract.
If after 5 days, the contract
is not updated, please contact the Service Support Center (SSC) at
www.cisco.com/go/ssc; or contact your Service Contract Sales Rep (SCSR).

Problem Details: Hi Team,

We disconnected the power cable at the back of the chassis connecting to PM0. Despite its status reflected as ""FAILED or NO PWR"" under the show environment command, the LED status remain as ""GREEN"" under command ""show led"". The physical LED on the PM0 is off. We repeated the same test on the other power modules, however, they exhibit the same behavior. We are expecting it to be ""OFF"" under the command ""show led"" as we conducted the same test on a different chassis.

Below are the logs:

sysadmin-vm:0_RSP0# Hi Team,

We disconnected the power cable at the back of the chassis connecting to PM0. Despite its status reflected as ""FAILED or NO PWR"" under the show environment command, the LED status remain as ""GREEN"" under command ""show led"". The physical LED on the PM0 is off. We repeated the same test on the other power modules, however, they exhibit the same behavior. We are expecting it to be ""OFF"" under the command ""show led"" as we conducted the same test on a different chassis.

Below are the logs:

SSL Certificate Signed Using Weak Hashing Algorithm

CVE-2004-2761 ""SSL Certificate Signed Using Weak Hashing Algorithm""
Firepower/FMC is not affected by this vulnerability because of below reason.
""SSL certificates are used in two places in the product:
for the web server and for the [SSL] tunnel connections between Sourcefire devices.
Web server - The default SSL keys that ship with the product for the web server use an MD5 hash.
However, this key is not signed by a trusted CA.
The customer can replace this certificate with their own that uses a stronger hash algorithm.
[SSL] tunnel connections - The tunnel connections also use SSL keys that are signed using MD5 hashes.
However, these certificates are signed by a CA that is internal to the DC and only this CA is trusted for authenticating the certificates.
Therefore, an attacker would not be able to spoof a valid certificate for these connections.""

The customer reported: After replacing one server heartbeat timeout was reported between the primary and secondary units in cluster. 

Failure Analysis Investigation: 
On receipt of this FP8300-STACK-K9 (JMX1849809J) and FP8300-STACK-K9 (JMX2007805C), the failure data was reviewed and a visual inspection of the units was performed. Both units passed a visual inspection.

The customer's symptom was duplicated on both units. Both units powered on normally, however after each unit booted to OS, the boot log showed Stacking errors. The issue was isolated to the images on both units. Both units were re-imaged. Afterward both units booted to OS successfully and passed all diagnostic testing with no further issues.

Failure Analysis Conclusion: 
The fault was isolated to corrupted OS images on both units. This case is being closed as 'Fault isolated'.","['ASA', 'CISCO FIREPOWER', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', '6.1.0.3.57', '6.2.3.80', '6.2.3.15.38', '6.4.0.102', '6.5.0.1', '6.2.3.83', '6.4.0', '6.3.0']","['FPR9K-SM-24', 'FPR-C9300-AC', 'FS4000-K9', 'FP8300-STK40G-K9', 'FP8350-K9', 'FP8300-STACK', 'FPR9K-SUP']",6.4.0.102,FP8300-STK40G-K9,True,True

Hi Midhul,

Below is the content I have shared with customer –

“We had raised EFA for two switches – switch 1 (S/N : FCW2426C0RH) and switch 2 (S/N : FOC2425U01A).

The issue was identified as hardware failure of a component in one of the stacking unit of switch1 (S/N : FCW2426C0RH).
No hardware issue identified on switch2.
So the hardware failure on switch1 caused the reload of the stack.”

Please confirm that the above content is accurate.
After that I think we are good to close the case.


Thanks and Regards,
Sunitha

Hi Sunita,

I have checked on the EFA reports. On the switch  PID : C9300-48U-A=, S/N : FCW2426C0RH FA-0465744. The issue was isolated to the single component inside ASIC.  On the second EFA FA-0466525  PID : C9300-48U-A=, S/N : FOC2425U01A the issues were not duplicated after testing. So the FA was closed mentioning the same.

The issue was with the C9300-48U-A=, S/N : FCW2426C0RH. Were the ASIC was bad. This was causing the issue here.

Sorry for the delay and confusion initially on this. Hope this clarifies the query

Hi Midhul,

I checked the SR notes on this as you are not able to share the detail report.
From the notes, what I see is for the switch with serial number FOC2425U01A, it does not mention in the below report about ASIC failure. ASIC issue below is reported only for FCW2426CORH from what I see. Sorry, please correct me if my understanding of below data is wrong.

[cid:image001.png@01D71CD2.605C4A90]

1)Can you please take a look at the detailed EFA report and confirm if it says that both the switches with serial numbers FOC2425U01A and FCW2426CORH are confirmed for hardware ASIC failure in their stacking units?
2)Also each of this switch has two stacking units, are both stacking units of each switch having the ASIC failure implying total 4 stacking units hardware failed?

Kindly confirm after verifying on the above two points as we need to share this info to our customer.


Thanks and Regards,
Sunitha

Hi Sunitha,

I have checked the EFA report, the issue is with the stacking module. We have the EFA report is attached externally on the SR.  Detailed report cannot be shared across.  Hope this clarifies the query. Is it ok for us to close the SR if there is no further pending concersns.

Also can the efa report be shared with us?

Regards to the EFA report, I understand we have submitted for two switches.
Can you help confirm of the ASIC hardware issues applies to both switches?

Thanks and Regards,

++ This logs point out that switch-2 has neighbor learning issue on stack port 1/1 and Stack-port1/2.

********************************************************************************

Currently Customer is now replacing the faulty switch with new received switch.
Onsite engineer is now checking the health and performance of the switch.
customer requested assistance while onsite engineer will add the switch in stack.


current status :

we have two switches which need to be replaced and EFA to be processed as well. 
We have RMA and EFA done RMA(801376583), FA ID FA-0465744 
we need to create RMA  and EFA for the switch 2. it was covered under a different contract
As of now logistics added the CCO Sunita Nair to the contract 200221213 on which we have FOC2425U01A (sw 2) covered
we will create the RMA once the system is updated and the EFA as well 

As of now we do not have any further network impact seen. 

we saw the following trace logs

++ This logs point out that switch-2 has neighbor learning issue on stack port 1/1 and Stack-port1/2.
++ This can be issue due to stack cable or switch hardware itself.
++ We have already replaced stack cable from your inventory.
++ We need to replace the switch-2 in stack and monitor further.
********************************************************************************

Currently Customer is now replacing the faulty switch with new received switch.
Onsite engineer is now checking the health and performance of the switch.
customer requested assistance while onsite engineer will add the switch in stack.


current status :

we have two switches which need to be replaced and EFA to be processed as well. 
We have RMA and EFA done RMA(801376583), FA ID FA-0465744 
we need to create RMA  and EFA for the switch 2. it was covered under a different contract
As of now logistics added the CCO Sunita Nair to the contract 200221213 on which we have FOC2425U01A (sw 2) covered
we will create the RMA once the system is updated and the EFA as well 

As of now we do not have any further network impact seen. 

we saw the following trace logs

*   restarted the services , Application server came back.
*   no core dump generated.
This should be generated if high CPU caused the system crash.
*   George   confirmed that authentication latency was seen earlier along with high CPU:
?  Explained that as Core dump was not generated it is difficult to pinpoint which thread was hogging CPU  and caused the  High latency and  triggered Application server initializing.
?  In case the issue happens again we need to collect thread dump and heap dump from CLI for analysis:
?  We also need the output of ""tech top "" for identify the process causing high CPU.
Here's what @Aaron Sanabria Martinez (asanabri)<mailto:asanabri@cisco.com> troubleshooted regarding NTP after my shift ended:
You noticed that timezone was on UTC ,  the rest of the nodes in the deployment are in Singapore
But you did not complete the step as it will restart the applications server on the node.
Now we noticed that the primary node is having ntp server issues, ntp service is down, when we do #show NTP we get the following error: ""506 Cannot talk to daemon."" .
As  mentioned this issue is related to the following bug: CSCvw03693<https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw03693> which we confirmed by getting the following output from CLI:
hsdc-pan-nac01/admin# show logging system  messages | inc chronyd
2021-10-28T12:46:06.701968+00:00 hsdc-pan-nac01 chronyd[117365]: chronyd version 3.2 starting (+CMDMON +NTP +REFCLOCK +RTC +PRIVDROP +SCFILTER +SECHASH +SIGND +ASYNCDNS +IPV6 +DEBUG)
2021-10-28T12:46:06.703775+00:00 hsdc-pan-nac01 chronyd[117365]: Fatal error : Could not get chrony uid/gid
2021-10-28T12:46:06.704586+00:00 hsdc-pan-nac01 chronyd: Could not get chrony uid/gid
2021-10-28T12:46:06.717983+00:00 hsdc-pan-nac01 systemd: chronyd.service: control process exited, code=exited status=1
2021-10-28T12:46:06.725924+00:00 hsdc-pan-nac01 systemd: Failed to start NTP client/server.
Now the work around for is that is to create user chronyd was not created during the upgrade, so the work around will require us to gaint root access to the PAN and create that user and assign it to proper group, then we will restart the chronyd service.
During inter build from 2.6 to 2.7 or higher, post-osupgrade converts ntp to chrony, by removing ntp configs and creating chrony user.
At the point where post-osupgrade writes the change to running config, startupcfg loads /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow from storedconfig.
Hence, the user never gets created and we see ntp failures after upgrade.
ACTION PLAN:
*   Cisco TAC will login to Root shell and apply the workaround for CSCvw03693<https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw03693>
*   Timezone will be changed on PAN node to Singapore (this will cause Ise application services to restart)
Let me know if you require further clarification regarding any of the points above.

Below are the details of the vulnerabilities. 

The application uses Angular Version 1.7.9 (Release date, 19 Nov 2019) which is susceptible to the following vulnerabilities: 
• Cross Site Scripting: Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). XSS may be triggered in AngularJS applications that sanitize user-controlled HTML snippets before passing them to JQLite methods like JQLite.prepend, JQLite.after, JQLite.append, JQLite.replaceWith, JQLite.append, new JQLite and angular.element.
Reference: https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-ANGULAR-572020

CVE-2020-7676: angular.js prior to 1.8.0 allows cross site scripting. The regex-based input HTML replacement may turn sanitized code into unsanitized one. Wrapping ""<option>"" elements in ""<select>"" ones changes parsing behavior, leading to possibly unsanitizing code.

++ I can see the device interfaces went to bypass mode on May 30 at 13:03:33 and automatically recovered at 13:03:36 (recovered in 3 seconds), unfortunately I am unable to pinpoint the exact reason why the interfaces went to bypass mode from the troubleshoot file logs.

Note: Even for further investigation, I will not be able to escalate this case to the engineering team as you are running on version 6.4.0.12  which is end of support from engineering end.

++ I have checked the current overall health of the device and it seems fine, only one things I have noticed that we are getting the below messages which is pointing to memory issue, this issue has been already reported under the defect CSCvs42388 and the fixed version is 6.6.5.2 and workaround is to reload the device.

May 30 13:03:34 IPS-Border-PGP-sensor01 snort[10272]: Memory stats information for preprocessor is NULL

++ You cannot upgrade the firepower 8350 to 6.5.0.2 because the final supported version for 8350 sensor is 6.4.0 trend, hence in future if you encounter above memory issue you need to perform the cold reboot.

++ As this device is up and running from more than 300 days, hence just for safer side you can perform the cold reboot during the MW.

++ Since 30th May 2022 to till date no issue has been reported (around 60 days).","['ASA', 'NA-CIN_CLOSE_SW', 'CISCO FIREPOWER', '5.4.0.8.23', 'NCS ALARMS & EVENTS', 'CISCO FIRESIGHT DEFENSE CENTER', '961', 'PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND', '6.1.0.3.57', '8.3', '6.1.0.5.45', '6.0.1.1206', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', '6.2.3.80', 'FPHIGH', '6.2.3.83', '6.2.3.4', '6.2.3.10.59', '6.4.0.102', '6.4.0.9.62', '6.4.0.8.28', '6.3.0.2.67', '6.6.4', '6.4.0', '6.4.0.10', '6.7.0.1', '6.6.5', '9.10.1', '6.2.3.6', '6.1', '6.2.3']","['ASA5500-HW=', 'FS4000-BUN-K9', 'FS4000-K9', 'WCS-APL-PA-K9', 'FPR-C9300-AC', 'FP8300-STK40G-K9', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_HW', 'FP8300-STACK', 'FP8350-K9', 'FP8250-K9', 'FP8300-STACK-K9', 'FPR-C9300-AC-WS', 'FP7110-BASE-FI-K9', 'FPR9K-SM-36', 'FP8360', 'FPR9K-SM-36=', 'FP8300-STK40G-K9=', 'FPR9K-SUP', 'FP8360-CTRL-LIC']",6.4.0,FP8300-STACK-K9,True,True

Problem Details: Hello Support,

According to the documentation for the controller VMs, its stated that the memory reservation for my HX model HX240c-M5SX is 72GB.
However this is much too high in my opinion, as in my cluster, each ESXi node only has a total of 128GB of ram. That means that 56% of the available RAM is currently in use by this storage controller. I know that this memory is reserved to ensure that there will be no performance degradation/contesting of resource between production VMs and storage controllers. 

However, because the storage controller is using so much memory, I can only provision a handful of VMs. Because of this constraint, I highly doubt that performance will be affected if the memory is reduced for these controller VMs.

Is it possible to reduce  the memory reservation on the storage controller VMs? How do I go about doing so? Any performance impact that I'm not aware of?

Problem Details: Hi Cisco TAC,

We have troubleshooted this CPU Spike issue at C6807-XL switch with the mentioned case number( SR688275557).

But Engineer already cloesed the case .So, now we want to reopen the case for this issue.

As per checked with TAC engineer last time, the issue was happened due to one of the multicast process(cmfib) .

This process is responsible for updating multicast entries on the switch.

Now want to know the capacity of the Catalyst 6807XL on handling the multicast traffic on control plane and data plane.

Thanks. ++ The issue is initially addressed in SR 688275557

++ Customer has removed this ACL now as he needs to receive that traffic
++ Further educated customer that multicast traffic can be limited using multicast rate limiter feature","['155.1', '12.2.33', '15.5.1', '15.1.2']","['C6807-XL', 'AIR-CT8540-K9']",15.5.1,C6807-XL,True,False

Recently we have a redundant test for the device ASR-9001-S
first question 
we have a sub-interface  GigabitEthernet0/0/0/5.2288.  
this interface is binding to vrf JXXXX
then we use this sub-interface p2p ip address to built ibgp neighbour with peer

the question is when we shut down the device. why the BGP is not down immediately need to wait the hold time expires. but if the BGP is built via a physical interface it will be down immediately.

second question.
snmp-server traps optical
snmp-server traps optical-ots

[1] Called the customer (John) on phone number +65-8189-2101 and discussed the issue.
[2] As researched latest through the case and recent EEM script logs, updated the customer that SNMP has been observed contributing to high CPU utilization on the 6509 switch but not generating even minimum SNMP stack traces therein which is not sufficient for SNMP investigation.
[3] Also, noticed lot of netdr captures in the EEM script output which might be suppressing other (SNMP) commands, however not sure.  The ""show tech""/""show logging"" showed multiple Multicast/IGMP queries being punted to CPU.
[4] The customer added that they had 20 units with same switch hardware and software, of which, nearly 3-4 swtches have been showing high CPU utilization.  Hence we suspect something common at IOS level causing this issue.
[5] Since current script outcome is still not clear for SNMP investigation, we decided to consult the issue with LAN-Switching engineer who would review the netdr output to come up with conclusion before working further to SNMP logs.

Hello Baby John,
I have reviewed the logs collected by the scrip.
Please be advised that many of the CPU spikes recorded were not caused by the SNMP but by the SSH process.
During that times user”cw2k” has been connected to the device from ""dale2.network.nus.edu.sg”
In terms of the CPU spikes that indeed were caused by “SNMP Engine” process, unfortunately the decode of the functions doesn’t point us to any specific OID.
In this case, as discussed yesterday, I suggest performing following actions:
1.
Keep the script in place, so that have timestamps on when the problem is caused by “SNMP Engine” process.
Alternatively you might want to configure CPU threshold notifications using: ""process cpu threshold type total rising 80 interval 10 falling 40 interval 10”
2.
You might try configuring SNMP view and excluding few of the tables that are known to spike the CPU when polled.
You might want to try applying SNMP View similar to the following one:
********************************************
snmp-server view cutdown iso included
snmp-server view cutdown ciscoFlashMIB excluded
snmp-server view cutdown 1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21 excluded
snmp-server view cutdown 1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22 excluded
snmp-server view cutdown 1.3.6.1.2.1.3 excluded
snmp-server view cutdown dot1dTpFdbEntry excluded
!! and apply it to all of the community strings configured with commands similar to:
snmp-server community <write_community_string> view <any_word> RW
snmp-server community <read_community_string> view <any_word> RO
********************************************
3.
Consider running either “debug snmp packet” on affected switch or SPAN session capturing all SNMP traffic.
This information together with the timestamp captured in point (1) should help you determine which OIDs polled from the switch cause the spike.",['122.33'],"['WS-C6506-E-FWM-K8', 'VS-C6509E-S720-10G', 'WS-X6724-SFP']",122.33,WS-C6506-E-FWM-K8,False,False

As discussed on the phone, it looks like the problem is due to too much traffic being sent to the ACSs.
The previous engineer that you worked with provided the following action plan:
1.
Please verify if there is connectivity between each of ACS instance in your deployment and each of AD domain controllers.
2.
Please verify the load balancer because when doing test with bypassing it authentication was working fine.
3.
I have found two defects on switch and WLC side that could cause above behavior and it is related to 'state' attribute that is being sent.
For further troubleshooting please try to:
-          Reload one of affected WLC devices (or switch) and after that check if radius authentication from users connected to it are working fine
-          Instead of reloading you may try also to clear authentication session on one of affected WLC devices (or switch) and after that check if radius authentication from users connected to it are working fine
Please speak to your colleague and let me know where we stand on these action items.

Problem Details: Hi there,

I am using SIP on Cisco IP Phone 7911G. However, I realized that the packets need to pass through the router when two phones communicate. Moreover, the RTP packets also pass through the router.

How can I configure it in such a way that the phones direct the SIP packets to each other without passing through the router? 

To my knowledge, for SIP, once the INVITE and OK messages are exchanged, the proxy server, which in my case is the router, will not be required anymore. However, even after the messages are sent, all SIP and RTP packets still pass through the router.

-       As of today, DNA Center Assurance will not be able to detect if AP is not forwarding ICMP packets. You can however, create dhcp events to subscribe and develop webhook applications on your end to receive alerts.

Problem Details: DNAC - Radius server change for WLC (Cisco 8540 Wireless Controller) creates new WLAN ID on WLC, but doesn't change the auth/acct configuration of existing WLAN

Impacting WLC provisioning for radius change DNAC - Radius server change for WLC (Cisco 8540 Wireless Controller) creates new WLAN ID on WLC, but doesn't change the auth/acct configuration of existing WLAN

Impacting WLC provisioning for radius change timestamp : 2022-07-22T20:08:50.000+0000 || updatedby : jossprag || type : RESOLUTION SUMMARY || visibility : External || details : • Customer was able to successfully upgrade their lab DNAC to 2.2.2.9.
• After the upgrade, they provisioned the 5520 WLC and see if the WLANs were getting replaced or updated.
  • According to the config preview, audit logs, and the config comparison chart, the WLANs got replaced instead of getting edited.

• Myself, Jay, and Daisy explained to the customer again why that is happening.
  • The DNAC just got done upgrading, so there are bound to be config changes.
  • They made some changes at the site level, so the DNAC will be pushing configs from the site level, not at the global level.
  • They also made some changes on the Wireless page by pressing the ""Configure AAA"" button and selected the ISE server from the drop-down menu.

***** July 19th, 2022 *****
• Samir confirmed that upgrading the DNAC to 2.2.2.9, on their production DNAC, fixed the hundreds of line config changes that would be pushed to the WLC.
  • The DNAC is now updating/replacing if it needs to be updated/replaced and add new config if the config isn't on the WLC already.

• We explained how the naming system worked involving the profile name on the WLC.
  • The DEs of the WLC purposefully created a 32-character limit on the profile name of the WLANs.
    • There was issues in the past when the DEs tried to extend the character limit, so they changed it back to being just 32-characters.
• Customer will need to make sure that every site, building, and floor have unique characters, so that the profile name on the WLC GUI will be unique too.

• Customer gave permission to close the case.","['1.3.1.4', '1.3.3.7', '2.1.2.7', 'NA - COMPONENT ONLY', '2.2.2.8', '2.2.2.9', '17.03.03', '2.2.3.4', '2.2.3.5', '4.0.4b', '16.12.04', '2.3.3.4', '2.3.3.7', '2.2.3.6', '2.1.2.6']","['DN1-HW-APL', 'DN2-HW-APL', 'DN2-HW-APL-XL', 'C9300-48UN', 'DN2-HW-APL-L', 'DN2-HW-APL-U', 'C9300-48U']",2.2.2.9,DN2-HW-APL-XL,False,True

693999363,emailin,"Hello George Kingsley Paul Sundararaj
>From logs uploaded to SR# 693999363 we have identified 1 Cisco UCS M5 servers that are not configured to use a beneficial memory RAS feature called ADDDC Sparing.
ADDDC Sparing tracks correctable memory errors and dynamically maps out failing regions by putting those banks or ranks into virtual lockstep mode.
This can prevent correctable errors from accumulating and becoming uncorrectable.
ADDDC Sparing is now the default Memory RAS configuration on Cisco UCS M5 servers with Intel Xeon Scalable processors.
Cisco recommends that all Cisco UCS M5 servers enable this feature.
Please refer to the two links below for more information about this feature.

My name is Pavan and I’ve taken ownership of this case.
From the problem description, I understand you are seeing one of the Aps as down on your monitoring tool.
*   Well, it looks like the AP has lost connectivity with the WLC while it is still up and running.
*   Do you see blinking or solid green LED on the AP?
*   Have you tried reloading the AP?
*   From the switch where the AP is connected, do you see the AP get IP address?
Can you collect the AP console output and share it across me?","['WLC AP JOIN', '9.8.3.143.0', '9.8.5.103.0', 'WLC INTERFACES/DHCP', '1.0']","['AIR-AP2802I-S-K9', 'AIR-CT8540-1K-K9', 'AIR-AP2802I-Z-K9']",WLC AP JOIN,AIR-AP2802I-S-K9,False,False

639070677,emailin,"Just wanted to follow up on our call.
I believe you were hitting CSCux53429 on your ASA which was causing the admin context to not create properly.
It is resolved in version 9.6.1, but if you were to upgrade your ASAs you'd also likely have to upgrade the 9300 chassis because as per the compatibility guide that version is only supported in FXOS 1.1.4:
http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/compatibility/asamatrx.html#pgfId-139390
However we were able to workaround it by reloading the ASA.
It's a condition that seems to be caused by creating and deletion of contexts, so it was likely triggered by something that was being configured today and I would not expect you to see the issue in production.
As discussed, I will proceed with the closure of this SR.","['ASA', 'FX-OS', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', '962.7', '9.7.1.4', '9.2.1.1.77', '971.4', 'IPS', '6.1.0.330', '6.2.0.1.59', 'CISCO FIRESIGHT DEFENSE CENTER', '6.2.2.81', '9.2.2.2.26', '981', 'FPHIGH', '6.2.3.79', '9.2.2.2.91', '981.7', '984.3', '6.2.3.15.38', '9.10.1.42', '6.4.0.7.53', '6.4.0.9.62', '4.8.1.157', '6.4.0.102', '9.14.2', '9.6.2', '2.8.1.152', '9.8.3', '9.8']","['FPR9K-SM-24-NEB', 'FPR9K-SM-24', 'FPR9K-SM-36', 'FPR-9300-E-K9', 'FPR9K-SUP-BLANK', 'FPR9K-NM-4X40G', 'FPR9K-SUP', 'FPR-CH-9300-AC', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_HW', 'FPR-C9300-AC', 'FS4000-K9', 'FPR9K-DNM-2X100G', 'FPR-C9300', 'FPR9K-ACK', 'FPR9K-SM-48', 'FPR-C9300-FIPS-KIT', 'FPR-4110-K9', 'FPR4110-NGIPS-K9', 'FPR9K-SM-36=']",ASA,FPR9K-SM-24,False,True

Therefore we need to make sure that there is no problem with cabling connections.
Please ensure that you go through the documentation that I have sent to verify how cables are connected.

680579404,emailin,"Only thing I see is error messages is errors related to communication between stacking mods.
Usually it is indication of cables not connected properly (for example wrong ports connected), damaged cables or damaged hardware ports on modules.
I can see however, that those ports have links up, so it may be rather due to some problems with cables.
First I would like you to check stacking cables.
Pease unplug them and plug again, ensure that left port on upper device is connected with left port on lower (cables cannot be crossed between ports)
Second, I would like to do a cold boot of the devices.
Meaning we need to shut it down, unplug power cables for about 5mins, and then start it again.
In order to do so, you will need to schedule maintenance window, since traffic disruptions will occur during this process.
I can see that your device is running in hardware bypass, meaning that traffic is going through without inspection.
After reboot, you will need to enable this bypass again by issuing command on primary device:
> configure bypass open s1p1
> configure bypass open s2p1
If after cold boot that situation will not change, we can proceed with cables RMA, and later entire device - if replacement of cables will not solve the issue.
Other option is that I can open escalation, so that escalation engineer will have a look at this setup prior to performing RMA.
Please let me know the status after verifying cables and after cold boot.","['CISCO FIREPOWER', 'NA - RMA', 'CISCO FIRESIGHT DEFENSE CENTER', '6.4.0.102', '9.12.4', '6.6.4']","['FPNM-2LR-10G-BP', 'FP8300-STACK-K9', 'FP8300-STACK', 'FP8300-STK40G-K9', 'FPNM-2LR-10G-BP=']",CISCO FIREPOWER,FP8300-STK40G-K9,False,False

Problem Description:
SMARTS showing OutOfRange alert for Blade 3/2 CPU temperature
Action/s Taken:
-          Requested for outputs to show temperatures UCS is detecting
-          Found that temperatures were all ok, but 3/2 CPU had higher temperatures than other blades
-          Suspect SMARTS HighThreshold for this class is set to 50 degrees and this is too low

As discussed on call, here is the explanation for would have dropped messages.
When there is an intrusion event showing “would have dropped”, it means the packet was passed already (was not dropped) before snort could determine that the packet matches to a rule which is configured to drop.
Now there can be multiple reasons for this behaviour.
As you have mentioned this is only happening on standby sensor, it could be due asymmetric routing as well.
There are three likely causes for this behaviour.
Cause 1
When snort receives a new stream of traffic it will put packets from that stream into a queue (buffer).
The packets in this queue will not be flushed to detection until one of a few things happens.
The most common occurances (but not all) of these things are:
-Snort sees enough data in the stream to determine the protocol(s) (or service(s)) in that stream.
This is called protocol aware flushing (PAF).
-Snort sees the end of the stream (snort must see both the client and the server end the connection).
-Snort does not see any additional packets from that stream for 180 seconds (this is the default timeout and can be configured in the stream 5 preprocessor settings).
Before the stream is flushed to detection (while the queue is being built), snort will send the packets in the stream on the wire (so it does not delay the traffic and inject latency).
Once the stream has been flushed to detection it will go through the rule evaluation.
All of the packets that have already been passed on the wire (packets in the queue) for the stream are evaluated at this time.
If any of the packets match a rule that is set to drop, snort will not be able to drop these packets as they have already been sent on the wire.
Cause 2
If a device is under heavy load, or the latency packet handling preprocessor is kicking in often, it can also cause this behavior.
If inline normalization is enabled and you are still seeing this behavior, the next likely cause is the latency handling packet preprocessor.
In certain cases, if a packet matches a rule that is set to drop, but that packet crossed the latency packet threshold, it's possible that the packet was fast-pathed before it could be dropped.
Why this happens depends on when the check is done for the packet time, and when the rule triggered.
Cause 3
Traffic passing through the sensor twice.(two different inline sets)
There are chances that when traffic is passing through sensor twice, it trigger rule with ""Would have dropped"".
For example, a 5 packet HTTP GET request whose first packet triggers a rule is blocked the first time through the sensor, only last packet will be dropped.
The second time through the sensor, it will see only 4 packets.
The connection got dropped, but when it finally flushes the partial get request because it is pruning the session, it will trigger the same rule with ""Would have dropped"" as the inline result.
Either ways, I would suggest following steps to troubleshoot more on this.
Enable inline normalization from NAP (Network analysis policy).
If you are using balance security and connectivity, please create a new NAP policy with base as “balance security and connectivity” and then enable Inline normalization.
More details about normalization.
http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/firesight-management-center/117927-technote-firesight-00.html
If inline normalization is enabled and this is still happening, then it's likely ppm causing the packet to be fast-pathed before it can be dropped.
In order to determine if this is happening, you have the following options:
Enable rule 134:3.
Enabling this rule will generate an event each time a packet has been fast-pathed due to reaching the threshold set in the latency packet handling preprocessor.
If you enable this rule, and see another event with no inline result or ""would have dropped"" and you see an event for rule 134:3 at this same time, it's very likely that ppm is causing this.

Sorry for the late response.
I am afraid that there is no direct way to achieve what you would like to do.
However, I would like to tell you about existing possibilities.
There are two worth mentioning:
1.
You can configure thresholding for your Intrusion rules, so an event will be generated only after some rule fires enough times (defined by your threshold) during a period of time (also defined).
If you configure it this way along with email alerts, you will receive an alert only if the conditions were met (eg.
if you configure a threshold for a rule to generate an event after 10 hits, you will receive an email only after the rule fires 10 times).
The caveat here is that thresholding cannot be limited to email alerts only, so it will also work for your dashboard and every other logging destination.
Also, there is no option to configure it for file events.
2.
The second option is to configure a correlation policy.
It can give you a possibility to generate a notification whenever there will be a specific Intrusion or Malware event, however it does not provide you a direct way to count these events.
For Intrusion events, you can count connections during which those events occurred.
This feature is called a 'connection tracker'.
The correlation policy is a very powerful tool in general, however it may require a lot of time to configure it and adjust to your needs.
Below you can find links to the documentation, so you can review these options that I just mentioned.

682159523,problemdescription,"HW

Roughly 60% of ICMP traffic through the box is dropped with following trace output:

Type: CONN-SETTINGS
Subtype:
Result: DROP
Config:
class-map any-tcp
 match any
policy-map global_policy
 class any-tcp
  set connection conn-max 0 embryonic-conn-max 0 random-sequence-number disable
service-policy global_policy global

The class-map being matched is intended to match only TCP traffic, but in reality it has a ""match any"" statement, so ICMP traffic is being caught in it, and my suspicion is that some kind of buffer limit is being hit.

I initially advised that we would want to configure an ACL for ""permit tcp any any"" to match only TCP traffic and replace the class-map's match action with that one. However, I also found CSCvc79371, which was actually filed against this same hardware in another of this customer's SRs (680444855). Suspecting that the behavior might be caused by the bug, I had them clear xlates. This alleviated the issue only temporarily, and not completely (there was still considerable packet loss even after xlates were cleared on the primary).

We then failed over to the secondary unit and cleared xlates on all contexts, and after we did so, we did not observe any additional packet loss.

However, there is still a notable difference between nat pool and xlate allocations on the pri and sec boxes; the Active unit always shows more conns allocated than the Standby unit does, which indicates to me that the issue is at least partially caused by CSCvc79371.

I also noticed a large number of LU Allocate Failures (%ASA-3-210005) for TCP and UDP traffic on the Standby after the failover, which makes me think that perhaps there's a problem with memory. Utilization on the Pri/Stby is listed at 127% (a cosmetic bug), though block usage for 9344 was depleted at some point, so it may be a memory allocation problem on the Primary.","['ASA', 'FX-OS', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', '962.7', '9.7.1.4', '9.2.1.1.77', '971.4', 'IPS', '6.1.0.330', '6.2.0.1.59', 'CISCO FIRESIGHT DEFENSE CENTER', '6.2.2.81', '9.2.2.2.26', '981', 'FPHIGH', '6.2.3.79', '9.2.2.2.91', '981.7', '984.3', '6.2.3.15.38', '9.10.1.42', '6.4.0.7.53', '6.4.0.9.62', '4.8.1.157', '6.4.0.102', '9.14.2', '9.6.2', '2.8.1.152', '9.8.3', '9.8']","['FPR9K-SM-24-NEB', 'FPR9K-SM-24', 'FPR9K-SM-36', 'FPR-9300-E-K9', 'FPR9K-SUP-BLANK', 'FPR9K-NM-4X40G', 'FPR9K-SUP', 'FPR-CH-9300-AC', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_HW', 'FPR-C9300-AC', 'FS4000-K9', 'FPR9K-DNM-2X100G', 'FPR-C9300', 'FPR9K-ACK', 'FPR9K-SM-48', 'FPR-C9300-FIPS-KIT', 'FPR-4110-K9', 'FPR4110-NGIPS-K9', 'FPR9K-SM-36=']",ASA,FPR9K-SM-24,False,False

- Already shared two info of potential suspect:
1. The class-map any-tcp that uses match any and not isolated to tcp. Note that action applied only to this class-map is only meant for tcp
- Mentiioned also that the nat pool do not match on both active and standby which is matching bug CSCvc79371.
- Customer requested an action plan in writing before doing the failover or to be used to get approval. I just sent that as of this writing.

- This is a problem that is reported on bug :
CSCvc79371    ASA nat pool not getting updated correctly.
- Note that this issue is still happening despite the connectivity issue no longer exists.
Reason being is the bug CSCvc79371 is fixed only 9.6.3.
However, we have engaged BU/development in order to get second opinion if we got the right bug.
This is what Scott started this morning.
- The explanation we have in here is it because the NAT/xlate is not replicated to the standby, therefore all dependent process (e.g.
conns) are also affected of not being replicated to the standby.
But note that this does not seem to impact the connectivity issue at this if the throughput issue indeed went away.
- Nevertheless, rebooting the primary due to the upcoming 213 days APR issue might have a better chance in doing recovery procedure if it's a must that we make primary as the active firewall.

First of all , thanks for the link your provide , but that document not so clearly to help us to understand how should we implement it.
Based on below capture , how should I  get average-rate and burst-rate value and any recommended value from cisco.
If we enable scanning-threat detection on ASA , may I know what kind of traffic will inspect by scanning-threat , is here any ALC to use for classify the source IP Range only apply to Scanning-threat detection
For example.
we only want to block port scanning source IP range from 201.31.203.0/24 , and the rest of the Network range Allow.

Sorry for the Delayed response.
I was occupied on an ongoing WebEx.
My Apologies for the miscommunication here with Chen Hai Biao, the other day.
I should have conveyed the severity change note to him while on the call, as I mentioned to him on the summary mail after our yesterday’s WebEx session.
Since it was not a network down situation as we observed on call and the device was working fine at the time, I had the severity reduces to P3 and again keeping it FTS would have delayed the resolution and analysis, since the Sev was not a Network Down situation.
I personally apologies on that note as well, as I did not convey the same to Chen Hai Biao and kept the case with me.
I will be providing an update on the RCA in an Hour and will try  discuss the same further with Chen Hai Biao on proceedings of the case ahead.

According to the problem description, you have questions regarding the bytes value seen in syslog messages like the following...
13:52:53 McQueen:%ASA-6-302014:Teardown TCP connection 3858636870 for outside:103.64.12.158/62408 to inside:137.132.21.7/993 duration 2:18:19 bytes 242603785 Connection timeout

Answer:
The 'bytes' value represents the total bytes transferred during the life of the connection before the connection was torn down.

Based on what you provided, those appear to be new connection attempts.
I googled TCP port '61616', and that port is used for ActiveMQ.
Based on what I read about it, ActiveMQ is designed for the purpose of sending messages between two applications.
So, it makes some sense that those are new connection attempts.
I've also provided a link to the ASA syslog message guide.
This guide provides explanations for the different syslogs, such as '106100'.

If the Traffic log 2 is a return traffic of Traffic log 1, it is suppose match the ACL 1 as it is stateful firewall...
However we captured the logs matching a different rule [ACL 2].
Another logs we attached for similar scenario where all the source port is (http) which looks more like a return traffic but matching a different INCOMING rule.
We need to understand is there any asymmetric situation here or it is purely a new connection..

First thing is to understand what kind of traffic customer is reporting to be slow, then analyzing the troubleshoot files and traffic patterns we should be able to tell if there is a problem with the IPS.
We know many speed test tools like iperf or web browsing tools generate one large flow and that is a known situation.
If you have slowness on specific traffic or the whole network during normal operation please generate a troubleshoot file of the sensor as for http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/sourcefire-defense-center/117663-technote-SourceFire-00.html noting the time (and timezone) you are experiencing that slowness and upload it to https://cway.cisco.com/csc so we can analyze the issue.
If you are working on a benchmark/test that is outside TAC scope and you should engage the Advanced Services team as they will provide you tools and tests to size and verify the proper configuration of the IPS.","['CISCO FIREPOWER', 'FSIGHT', '6.1.0.3.57', 'ASA', '9.6.1']","['FS4000-BASE-K9', 'FP8300-STK40G-K9', 'FS4000-K9', 'FP8350-K9', 'FP8360-K9', 'FP8300-STACK']",CISCO FIREPOWER,FP8350-K9,False,True

My name is Preeti and I have assisted you today on this case.
Please find the meeting summary :
Problem Description :
You have a DNS forwarder server where you are running a script which queries a list of domain name (10K domains) for 120 seconds
Troubleshooting Done:
** during the session we found that certain domains like "" epg.tvesou.com.w.alikunlun.com"" which you could see DNS sinkhole
** we verified and found that you have DNS policy configured with DNS sinkhole enable with ""block and log connections"" action
** DNS rules handle traffic based on the domain name requested by a host.
** we also verified that the concerned domain was in CISCO SI DNS FEED
** there is a script configured on the server which queries different external DNS server for the configured list of domain name at interval of 10 sec for 120 sec
** we found that after 60 sec, the server queries for 2K domain ( not for 10K domain)
** as discussed this change is not due to firepower, as firepower won't be able to stop the server form querying domain name to external DNS server
Next-Action Plan :
** as discussed kindly check why the DNS server queries reduces to 2K domain after 60 sec and why there is a behavior change","['CISCO FIREPOWER', 'FSIGHT', '6.1.0.3.57', 'ASA', '9.6.1']","['FS4000-BASE-K9', 'FP8300-STK40G-K9', 'FS4000-K9', 'FP8350-K9', 'FP8360-K9', 'FP8300-STACK']",CISCO FIREPOWER,FP8350-K9,False,True

682602681,emailin,"Hello Li Xiaopei,
Sorry I was on PTO these weeks.
There are several things you can do before escalating to Cisco, first as you say verify that the system is not oversubscribed, then based on the number of CPUs, if it is only one or a few of them, you could check the connection events and sort them by the amount of traffic transmitted to identify the elephant flows.
If it is only a specific flow that is having latency then you could verify with the firewall engine debug if you see it pending on a rule a long time, meaning it might be spending too much time trying to match a rule without being able to.
Reordering the rules might help here.
I will check internally to see if there are any trainings available that Cisco could deliver for you to get better knowledge on this.","['CISCO FIREPOWER', 'FSIGHT', '6.1.0.3.57', 'ASA', '9.6.1']","['FS4000-BASE-K9', 'FP8300-STK40G-K9', 'FS4000-K9', 'FP8350-K9', 'FP8360-K9', 'FP8300-STACK']",CISCO FIREPOWER,FP8350-K9,False,True

Regarding your question, there is no supported way for you to see the traffic through each snort instance, what you can see on the FP8350 web interface is traffic through each inline pairs.

Hello Li, All,
My name is Nikolay and I'll assist you with Service Request 683126151.
The Issue is that you have a health error:
The TCAM process is down on NFE 3
The NFMessD process is down on NFE 3.
Actions Taken so far:
I executed those commands:
# cat /var/sf/run/bb-health > /var/log/bb-health.out
# lsnfe -vvv > /var/log/lsnfe.out
# lspci |grep 19ee > /var/log/lspci.out
# nfm-burnin.sh > /var/log/nfmburnin.out
# nmutil > /var/log/nmutil.out
# nfmtest > /var/log/nfmtest.out
# nfmtest_sysinfo.sh > /var/log/nfmtest_sysinfo.out
# nfmtest_sysinfo.sh -X > /var/lognfmtest_sysinfoX.out
# dmidecode > /var/log/dmidecode.txt
Part of the logs says that there is no issue but another part says there is.
Action Plan:
We have to perform Cold Reboot of the appliance.
Take output from the commands again.
Compare them with the existing ones.
If there is no change on the behavior, next step is to reimage the appliance.
If reimage do not change the situation an RMA have to be created.
We're currently on Webex and will continue troubleshoot the issue.

As discussed over the phone, we will not process the RMA because the device is not defective as confirmed by Cisco TAC.
Instead, we would like to proceed with the original recommendation by Cisco which is to re- image the sensor and apply the patch.
I will send the action plan later.

684146587,emailin,"Thanks for the time on webex.
Here's the summary:
*         Intermittently some clients are not getting IPv4 address and show up with link local address
*         The DHCP process is not getting complete for these clients and the packets are probably getting dropped somewhere along the path
*         We notice that the old WLC has DHCP proxy diabled globally while new one as it enabled
*         This may be the cause of the problem as WLC will be sourcing all the DHCP packets instead of the client and there is chance for it to get dropped by the server
As discussed, please test by disabling proxy and let me know how it goes.
If issue still persists after this change, we will need captures on WLC uplink as well as DHCP server to see the dhcp exchange.","['WLC RRM/RF/CLEANAIR', 'WLC CLIENT INTEROP', '8.3.140.0', '802.11AC', '9.8.2.166.0', '9.8.3.143.0', 'NA-CIN_CLOSE_SW', 'NA - COMPONENT ONLY', '9.8.5.151.0', '9.8.3.150.0', '9.8.5.160.0', '9.8.10.130.0', '9.8.10.162.0', '9.8.10.151.0', '9.8.5.171.0', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', '9.8.5.140.0', '9.8.10.171.0', '9.8.5.135.0', '4.0.1a', '8.10.185.0', '8.10.171.0', '120.13', '8.10.183.0', '8.3.131.0', '17.3.5b', '8.10.151.0', '8.10.161.0', '12.0.13', '8.10.150.0', '1.0', '8.10.130.0', '8.3.150.0', '8.5.161.0', '8.5.135.0', '8.5.171.0', '8.5.140.0', '8.3.143.0', '8.4', '16.12.4', '16.12.3s']","['AIR-CT8540-1K-K9', 'AIR-CT8540-K9', 'NA-CIN_CLOSE_HW', 'C9120AXI-S', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_HW', 'AIR-CT8540-CA-K9', 'AIR-AP2802I-S-K9', 'AIR-CT8540-K9Z', 'AIR-BZL-C240M4', 'DN2-HW-APL-XL', 'WLC-AP-T', 'AIR-CT8540-SW-8.2']",WLC CLIENT INTEROP,AIR-CT8540-K9,False,False

CASE SUMMARY:
Problem description:
-          Enabled IGMP querier on vlan interface on ASA on Firepower 9300.
Action taken:
-          Informed the below
IGMP Snooping Querier is a concept specific to a device that connects several multicast senders and receivers at Layer 2 with no multicast routing involved.
In other words, it would only be applicable
to a switch.

IGMP Snooping Querier is a concept specific to a device that connects several multicast senders and receivers at Layer 2 with no multicast routing involved. In other words, it would only be applicable
to a switch.

Since ASA is a firewall that always relies on PIM to route multicast traffic, IGMP Snooping in general and Snooping Querier designation in particular are not applicable to it.","['ASA', 'FPHIGH', '6.0.0.1005', 'CISCO FIREPOWER', '964.3', '9.14.3', '9.8.4.7', '9.8.2', '9.12.4', '9.14.2.15', '9.14.2.4', '9.8.1', '9.8.3']","['FPR9K-SM-24', 'FPR9K-SUP', 'FPR-C9300-AC', 'FPR9K-ACK', 'FS4000-K9', 'FPR-9300-E-K9', 'ASA5506-SSD', 'FPR9K-SM-36=', 'ASA5506-K9', 'FPR2130-ASA-K9']",6.0.0.1005,FPR-C9300-AC,False,True

Problem Details: Intermittent dropping the traffic by the P2P DENY policy as it is identifying the application as BitTorrent Intermittent dropping the traffic by the P2P DENY policy as it is identifying the application as BitTorrent timestamp : 2019-04-11T07:22:41.000+0000 || updatedby : raghukul || type : RESOLUTION SUMMARY || visibility : Internal || details : Issue 1: Mirror.nus.edu.org getting classified as BitTorrent
=============================================

he website  http://mirror.nus.edu.org though it is classified as Educational Institution, the content hosted on this site is basically firmware’s which are Linux variants.
++ When the user selects on the sub-directories there is an option to download the firmware with one of the below choices:

[cid:image001.png@01D3F1AD.612383B0]

++ Now, at this point if the user selects any option apart from the “torrent” download option, the rule evaluation works correctly and the application is not detected as P2P (BitTorrent) which is expected. The device treats this connection as a normal HTTP download.

++ However, if the user at this point selects the “torrent” download option which is the 5th entry in the image above. The download is initiated via the torrent client because the file is a torrent download.
++ The connection event at this point on the device are as shown below. This is where we detect the application as BitTorrent and this is the expected behavior.


Issue 2: Tag-Based versus Category based App Detectors:
==============================================

++ When we initiated the connection, we observed that the application protocol was detected as “HTTP” and the Web application was detected as “Web Browsing” for all the working and non-working scenario.
++ However, what is crucial is the “Client” field which was getting detected as BitTorrent and for that connection which was not getting blocked the “Client” field was rightly getting detected as “Browsers” (Chrome/Opera/Firefox).

++ The important factor to determine is how we decide on the “Client Field”. This field looks into the tags associated with the application detector and then based on that it determines the client in addition to looking at the user agent field.
++ In the past, we had seen false positive in client field detection when tags are used as part of the app detection. I was able to recreate the behavior associated with SSL and HTTPS traffic.

++ The rule that is configured to block BitTorrent is based on “Category” and “Tags”.
++ When it comes to app-detection and tags being used as criteria, it will not be precise as we are not really looking into the content that is being downloaded. Hence in your case, we observed that the connection even to the home page was being detected as a client with BitTorrent.

What do we do to avoid these false positives?
=====================================

++ The rule created to block the BitTorrent App needs to be configured based on Application Filter.
++ We need to get away with the Tag-based detection to make it more efficient and avoid the false positives.


Issue 3: Increasing the aggressiveness associated with BitTorrent:
===================================================

Increasing BitTorrent Detection Aggressiveness
----------------------------------------------------------------
We enhanced the system to share more information about specific flows throughout the system that can assist on the identification of a BitTorrent host, with the use of some specific aggressiveness settings we have allowed customers to add.

•    These settings can be added by editing the /var/sf/userappid.conf file in the FMC CLI and then doing a Policy Deploy to send all these configurations to the devices which are registered to the FMC.
•    These settings are NOT enabled by default to avoid any potential false positive issues that may occur in the system.
•    These capabilities are created by flagging specific hosts, or servers on a host as BitTorrent whenever we are not able to identify its traffic through any of our regular application detection algorithms. In other words, these capabilities only get triggered when the traffic we see is Unknown.

-Below is the configuration line needed to be add in /var/sf/userappid.conf :

appid<tab>bittorrent_aggressiveness<tab>80
•    Where <tab> is the actual tab space. It is very important to make sure that Tabs are added there instead of spaces, sometimes vi can mask a tab with a space so make sure that we are truly using tabs when we are adding these configurations.

-As described earlier, after doing this change in FMC, the policy has to be deployed again to the managed/concerned devices ( edit any rule in the access control policy, click on any of the tab in the rule e.g. application then click on save and you will get the option to deploy the same policy to the concerned devices )

+ And one more important thing we noticed from the attached syslogs is that there is only a single IP address ( 172.27.225.212 ) in all the 4 events of application getting allowed thus please fetch a report on historic data from syslog server ( application : BitTorrent, action : allow ) and analyze the output to make sure the IP address which are having these allow action to have further check on the machines.

+ In addition of this, please share the +,- 5 minutes logs from the time of occurrence of the concerned event i.e. Oct  9 03:59:52 , +,-5 mins and Oct  9 03:05:18 +,-5 mins to do further analysis.


Issue 4: After the upgrade, there was misclassification of VPN Client and AV Agent
================================================================

++ Issue was caused due to a bad app detector.
++ Raised a new defect with the engineering team.
++ Upgrade on the VDB solved the concern


Coming to the testing related to P2P and torrent blocking, here is what I used in the lab and was able to block all torrent traffic in the lab scenario:


  1.  Created a rule with the URL block with category highlighted as P2P (peer to peer)
     *   This category includes most of the torrent hosting websites.
     *   Advantage: We block known bad right upfront without putting load on snort to determine the applications.
  2.  Created a rule with app detector as p2p category
     *   This will address the concerns related to sites which are regular websites but support download of content via the torrent application.
     *   This rule is already configured in your case and we do not need any change for this.

Note: The URL rule created based on category should be placed above the app based rule. Logging to enabled only at the start of the connection.

Analysis Done:
============


  1.  Whenever we have application detection configured, the device needs some packets to identify what the application is.
  2.  Now, when we looked at the connection events on the FMC, we saw that the count for initiator and responder packets is non-zero (which is expected) also the bytes transferred under initiator and responder bytes was non-zero (again this is expected).
  3.  After this, we determine the application is torrent and then block the connection.
  4.  However, in the meantime the upstream device sees first few packets. In our case from the logs shared on the ASA we can see these connections having few bytes transferred.

This is expected behaviour and does not mean that torrent is not getting blocked.

Follow up questions for BitSight on report regeneration and addition details:


  1.  Can we have the amount of data transferred in the connection which is marked by them as torrent?
  2.  Additionally is it possible to provide details on the URL being referenced while the data is being downloaded?","['CISCO FIRESIGHT DEFENSE CENTER', 'CISCO FIREPOWER', 'FPHIGH', 'ASA', '6.2.3.5', '6.2', '6.2.3']","['FS4000-K9', 'FP8300-STACK', 'FPR9K-SM-36', 'FS4000-BASE-K9']",FPHIGH,FP8300-STACK,False,True

May 27 08:46:45: %OIR-SW1-6-INSREM: Switch 2 Physical Slot 1 - Module Type LINE_CARD  inserted
As seen above in the log pattern, CPU MONITOR is the KEEP ALIVE messages which is exchanged between the supervisor and the line card every 30 seconds.
If 6 continuous heartbeat messages are missed, the supervisor will force reload the line card at the end of the 6th heartbeat miss.
In such situations the crashinfo generated for the line card reload event gives the details of crash and list of stacks called prior crash.
However in our case the crashinfo file is generated with file size zero and hence we have no information on the root cause/trigger for crash.
From the following  LC monitor dump files  shared on the case we understand that there is a high CPU on the device post line card reload.
The high CPU was recorded due to processes like ""fw_lcp process"", ""Earl TML dfc blo"" and ""Lif main process"".
Below is an explanation on what these processes are and why they consume more CPU resource under certain circumstances:
20180626-231751943_lc_monitor_dump_20180527-004902
20180626-231751942_lc_monitor_dump_20180527-005023
20180626-231751940_lc_monitor_dump_20180527-004904
20180626-231751941_lc_monitor_dump_20180527-005021
""Lif stats hw rea"" and ""fw_lcp process"" have been seen in elevated levels on distributed linecards since at least early SXI releases according to my research.
There have been a number of bugs filed, that have in turn been closed because of the way the code functions.
Development has determined that if they try to reduce the amount of programming in these processes to try and lower the CPU utilization, then they run the risk of causing a larger service impact to the module/system because required processing is not happening in a timely manner.
EARL TML dfc blob is the process for EARL Transport management Library which will be used for transfer the EARL related tables, L2 Vlan database , L2 LIF, L2 PORT-Database, L2 shadow table, per vlan datastructures will be sent from the active supervisor to the new line card which is coming up.
Whenever new DFC line card comes up, first notification will be given to active supervisor and supervisor will start batching the list of tables and databases to linecard using ICC mechanism and Linecard will start receiving and downloading them into the Linecard memory and this will be required as part of the boot-up sequence of the Linecard.
These monitor file can be created when there is a high cpu utilization of LC which is usually happened when the LC is booted up.
If we refer to what the ""Earl TML dfc blo"" is responsible for,  the ""lc_monitor_dump"" is most likely created when the device boots up.
To summarize the above explanation- it is expected of the device to have high CPU immediately after a reboot or line card reload.
Due to lack of data generated during the time of issue (no corefile/ crashinfo with size 0 bytes) it would be difficult to speculate the possible cause of this issue.
Please let us know the following :
Ø  Is this is a repeated behavior on that specific line card or this is the first time the issue is seen for this line card
Ø  Do we have any monitoring device that can help us with possible CPU/memory utilization and user traffic pattern just before line card crash
Ø  Has device displayed symptoms of instability on SUP or in any other than the line card C6800-32P10G-XL
Based on our understanding for above queries we can suggest on the next course of action on this case.
Please let me know if you have any queries related to analysis shared above.

684742019,emailin,"Good Day,
Would like to share the steps carried out yesterday to isolate the failure.
1.
Removed the SD in slot 1 and tried to boot up the blade: Boot up successful, as the card status was Operable & Active.
2.
Put back SD in slot 1 and remove SD in  Slot 2: System failed to boot, this confirmed that this card has faulted.
3.
Put back SD in slot 2 and replaced SD in  Slot 1: System booted up, switched the card mode to trigger the sync
Kindly share this case (observations) to your next line of support to review the status reporting (both CLI & Web UI) of SD card[s] in various scenarios, I personally believe certainly there is a room for improvement with the status exchange/reporting esp.
with UCSM & SD card.
Kindly reference my another TAC case 684571478, where the SD card in Slot 1 doesn't show up in Web UI most of the time.
Also request to have steps similar to the one shared above to be advised in the RMA cases, when there is no clear indication of failure[s].","['2.2.3', 'NA - RMA', '4.0.4g', '4.0.2d', '4.1.3c', '4.1.3i']","['UCS-FI-6248UP-UPG', 'UCS-SD-64G-S', 'UCSB-B200-M5-U', 'UCSB-B200-M5', 'UCSB-B200-M4-U', 'UCSB-5108-AC2=']",NA - RMA,UCS-SD-64G-S,False,False

684830668,emailin,"Sorry for the delay in the response since I was Off-Shift
Thanks for briefing me about the issue.
I also had the chance to check the other SR .
I have reviewed the logs and found that there are correctable errors on the DIMM F1 and suspecting the same reason for the faults on the vCenter console.
Since these errors are Correctable errors and don't degrade the performance of server.
These errors can be corrected by resetting the memory.
I also noticed that these faults occur when the SEL is full.
Below is the document:
http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/servers-unified-computing/ucs-manager/whitepaper-c11-736116.pdf
I request you to carry out the following Action Plan:
1.
Clear SEL Logs on server 4/2 .
2.
Reset Memory Errors on DIMM F1.
3.
Reset sensors on vCenter
[How to clear the SEL logs]
1.
Access UCSM.
2.
Go to [Chassis] > [Chassis 4] > [Servers] > [Server 2].
3.
On the right side of the screen, go to SEL Logs, then click on Clear Logs on the page.
[How to reset the memory errors counter]
You can reset the memory errors by SSH'ing into the UCSM and execute the below commands:
ca-1-A# scope server 4/2
ca-1-A /chassis/server # reset-all-memory-errors
ca-1-A /chassis/server* # commit
Note: The above the commands are non-disruptive
Quick question to check if you have any performance impact due to this fault, Also let me know the current state of this server?
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions/concerns regards to this case.","['2.2.3', '2.2.2', '2.2.1', 'NA - RMA', 'NA - COMPONENT ONLY', '1.0.16', '4.0.4g', '3.2.2b', '4.1.3b', '4.2.1f', '4.2.1m', '4.1.1b', '4.1.3j', '3.1.2', '2.2.6', '2.0', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', '3.1.1', '4', '4.1.3c', '1.0', '4.2.1i', 'xxx', '3.2.3d', '4.0.4d', '2.1.3b', '1.4.3', '4.1.3d']","['UCSB-B200-M3-U', 'UCS-FI-6248UP-UPG', 'N20-C6508-UPG', 'UCSB-B200-M4-U', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_HW', 'UCSB-B200-M4', 'UCSB-B200-M5', 'UCSC-C240-M6SX', 'UCS-FI-6296UP', 'UCS-FI-6332', 'UCS-FI-6248UP', 'UCSB-5108-AC2', 'UCSB-5108-AC2-UPG', 'UCS-FI-6248UP=', 'SFP-H10GB-CU3M', 'UCS-ACC-6248UP']",2.0,UCSB-B200-M4-U,False,True

685386941,emailin,"Resending TAC’s response to everyone
Thank you for the update.
I have provided the firepower signature id in the previous email communication.
I am putting those details again :-
SID:42834
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET $HTTP_PORTS (msg:""MALWARE-CNC Win.Backdoor.Chopper web shell connection""; flow:to_server,established; content:""X-Forwarded-For""; nocase:; http_header:; content:""z9=base64%5fdecode""; fast_pattern:only; http_client_body:; content:""=%40eval""; http_client_body:; metadata:impact_flag red, policy balanced-ips drop, policy security-ips drop, ruleset community, service http; reference:url, www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/breaking-down-the-china-chopper-web-shell-part-ii.html<https://csone--c.na69.visual.force.com/apex/www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/breaking-down-the-china-chopper-web-shell-part-ii.html>; classtype:trojan-activity; sid:42834; rev:2; gid:1; )
As you can see in the above details, the reference article for the firepower snort signature is the same as the one being referenced by the end customer.
Which means, that the firepower snort signature is covering all the aspects of the Trojan.
Earlier I had mentioned only one specific signatures, but here are the details for all the signature which covers all the aspects of the signature.
Also, the initial data mentioned in the case represents the variation in snort id, which act like an improvisation to avoid false positives, it doesn't mention anywhere that there is a variation in the malware.
Concluding, the snort signature available on firepower systems is covering the malware in every aspect and there is no need of an custom signature.

My name is Bharat and I am the TAC engineer assisting you with the Service Request number 685451943.
Problem Description: As per our discussion over call,  I can understand that you were looking for the EFA of 3 modules : C6800-32P10G-XL.
Action Plan: As discussed , Please note that the faulty  parts  for which  you received  replacement in  SR: 1st: 685264658 and 2nd  685258992 , have been already returned to cisco .
So, EFA cannot be created for the mentioned faulty parts.
Please note  that when EFA is created for a part, cisco FACT team is engaged which  picks up the faulty parts from Site and delivers them to the EFA team for analysis.
But in our case, the  parts have already been returned to the normal warehouse.
For future reference , kindly be informed that when ever EFA   is required, please reach out to the assigned cisco engineer before returning the part.
For EFA there is a separate team: Cisco FACT team, which is engaged.
FACT team picks up the faulty part form site and delivers it to the concerend EFA team.
I will contact you as soon as I receive the information.

There is no specific (hard-set) limitation for the number of IP addresses that can be added to the SI Blacklist object.
Utilization of this feature is completely related to the CPU and Memory of the devices (FMC/FTD), and number of rules added on various policies as there is a wide variety of hardware models we sell.
Although, there is another option available as well for optimal device performance.
This option includes creating a network object group that includes all the IP addresses one would like to deny.
Then, in the access control policy a block rule is created with the aforementioned object.
Anytime one would like to deny more IP addresses, the new IP addresses would simply have to be added to the object.
Let me know if any questions.

Problem Details: User suddenly got disconnected. User suddenly was not able to see any broadcasted SSID. User suddenly got disconnected. User suddenly was not able to see any broadcasted SSID. timestamp : 2019-04-29T06:54:21.000+0000 || updatedby : vakarthi || type : RESOLUTION SUMMARY || visibility : External || details : 1.  reason for AP disjoin

Data DTLS issue is seen in Hello Verify causing CAPWAP tunnel to break and later AP sent Join request again to WLC. During this time, if AP was local mode the clients associated to it would have lost SSID broadcast signal.

2. Reason for AP load profile failure

  We see that reason for AP disjoin according to WLC is : 'AP has been reset buy the Controller'. The 1142 AP has a Controller association time of 6 days but AP uptime is much higher.
   We see that an AP had load profile failure for low channel utilisation and 14 clients -

[3/15/2019 9:42:10 AM]     Attached Clients............................. 14 clients

   The threshold set on the WLC if crossed, the load profile will fail. For example, on my lab set up the limit is 12 clients per AP radio. If 14 clients connect, the load profile will fail.

3. Reason for AP disjoin on switch
the reason for the APs to have disjoined from the switch can also be L2 issue in the path that would cause DTLS connection to break. This does not require the switch to go down to cause the ports to flap. However, we can see from the switch logs that on the day the APs disjoined that the switcport flapped.And even on the WLC, the reason for the AP disjoin is that 'AP got disconnected'

687222026,emailin,"Thanks for your time on the call today.
Running through the test today, it seems like we want to hold off on running the fix until next week.
As you requested, here's what we're going to do:
The suspected issue is CSCva57479 where the Root CA shows up in the trusted store, but the elasticsearch DB that runs context visibility isn't able to store the cert and fails trust.
The plan for our maintenance is to export the .pem of the root CA locally, go into the CLI root of the node, copy the exported cert into the filesystem, then add it to the file elasticsearch uses to store certs.
Once that file is appended with the root CA data, the context visibility page should start working again.
We also took a look at TCP dump filters to figure out how to filter by MAC address.
While the correct keywords are ""ether host"", it looks like the input validation will only allow lines with ""ip host"".
As a result, we made the rule
Ip host 1.1.1.1 or ether host aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
Which will work because there is no 1.1.1.1 traffic and we fill the requirement of having ""ip host"" in the input.
Since it sounds like you want to set up the new call for the same general time, I'm happy to hold on this case and set this up with you when you're ready next time, just let me know what day and time you're shooting for.
If you have any more questions about the fix process or anything else, just let me know.","['2.3.0.298', 'ISE', '2.3.0', '2.4.0']",['SNS-3595-K9'],2.3.0.298,SNS-3595-K9,False,True

As discussed, currently we have moved the secondary PAN node to Primary and the initial issue with the upload of the MAC Address was resolved.
Furthermore, we successfully remove the space from /opt  folder but now we are facing another issue where when accessing context visibility page there is a pop up with Internal server error.
I have checked the vcs logs and found the following warning without debug:

Problem Details: Hey Cisco TAC, 

We would like to seek your advise with the following case

Background:
We are going to deploy Catalyst 6807-XL and Nexus 7700 in the infrastructure. The end-to-end dscp-based QoS is configured in the current network so both N7K and C6807 have to align with the current QoS design. 

Problem:
As our N7K module only supports cos-based QoS queueing for ingress and egress traffic, we have to convert from dscp to cos in order to let it doing QoS queueing. When the traffic leave N7K and reach C6807, should we do cos-to-dscp conversion on C6800? 

 It can be illustrated in the below diagram in a simplified manner: 
C6800(dscp-based Qos)<----------->N7K(dscp-cos mapping/ cos-based Qos)<----------->C6800(dscp-based Qos)

Thanks and Regards

We don’t have necessary information since show tech was taken after reboot, we need to get show tech before reload.
In order to analyse the issue, either we need have the call while issue happening, this is not possible as per the discussion with satya since need to restore the services immediately.
Only option run the show tech and reload after that.
We have multiple EEM scripts aswell since we don’t know what type of issue(High cpu, memory), can’t run any EEM script.

For further analysis of your problem, please help to provide the following information:
1.
Would you please kindly describe your issue in detail?
Intermittently some wired users not able to connect to internet.
At the same time wireless users ( with wireless AP on the same switch ) have no such issues.
Switch reboot will resolve the issue so much until the issue resurface again at a later day.
( we can't predict when it happen, but it happens again ).
2.
What have you done to troubleshoot this issue?
Checked if the end device has IP.
( it has a valid IP) .
Rebooted the machine ( but it won't solve the issue)
3.
Any changes made (config/software/hardware/network) to this working set-up?
No changes.
4.
When you troubleshoot, any useful error message  please send it to us.
We checked the logs .
No useful info.
I could see 4 switches in the stack, uptime all the switches 6 hours, hole stack reloading ?
Just because of user pressure, I have rebooted the switch as it is the only way for now to get affected users on to network.
To help me understand the nature of your problem better, please let me know the following.
*             Current Business Impact (no.

Since the issue was reported on 16th sept when the device was disabled on the FMC or not sending heartbeat to the FMC. While checking the logs from 16th, I could see that some DB table optimization was happening and then I could see kernel logs. Post which we could see the device was not shutdown properly.

6.4.0.4 FMC WebUI cannot create a Series-3 stack
https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvs23750
Symptom:
The FMC WebUI when running 6.4.0.4 through 6.4.0.6 software will not allow the creation of FP8100, FP8200 or FP8300 stack.
The FMC WebUI will incorrectly display the error message, ""There are not enough available devices for a new stack"".
Conditions:
Customer has upgraded their FMC to one of the versions specified above in the ""Symptoms"" section.
Workaround:
Downgrade the FMC to 6.4.0 to allow the creation of a FP8100, FP8200 and FP8300 stack.
We are basically seeing the same symptoms even after reimaging the Sensors and registering them to the FMC, they do not show as available devices to form a stack.
This issue has been identified to be on the FMC not the Firepower 8350 sensors.
BU Engineer suggested the downgrade option after a discussion with Developer Engineer tracking the defect.

Can you confirm if the notification server is reachable from CMX during the time you stopped receiving notifications from CMX?

//This command reports the metrics for every Notification Receiver

CMX#cmxctl metrics notification

//API call which would show the rate at which the notifications are sent from CMX to NB

/api/config/v1/notifications/stats

You can collect Packet captures from CMX to check the flow -

 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless/connected-mobile-experiences/211536-Packet-Captures-on-Connected-Mobile-Expe.html
You can also check with tcpdump whether the packets for notifications are sent out of CMX.

If you have winscp, can you can copy the below files and share them with me -

/opt/cmx/var/log/configuration/error.log



/opt/cmx/var/log/configuration/server.log

You can also use CLI to access files on the CMX to share them with me.

Can you confirm if the notification server is reachable from CMX during the time you stopped receiving notifications from CMX?

//This command reports the metrics for every Notification Receiver

CMX#cmxctl metrics notification

//API call which would show the rate at which the notifications are sent from CMX to NB

/api/config/v1/notifications/stats

You can collect Packet captures from CMX to check the flow -

 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless/connected-mobile-experiences/211536-Packet-Captures-on-Connected-Mobile-Expe.html
You can also check with tcpdump whether the packets for notifications are sent out of CMX.

If you have winscp, can you can copy the below files and share them with me -

/opt/cmx/var/log/configuration/error.log



/opt/cmx/var/log/configuration/server.log

You can also use CLI to access files on the CMX to share them with me.

I have reviewed the information on the CMX Alerts and the Alerts are based on system resources or services that are down.

As you cans ee from the show module switch all we have that setup (quad-sup), so we will have one Active Chassis and One Standby chassis, the standby role will always be on the standby chassis, in this case if we never reload the Active supervisor (currently on chassis 1 slot 3) then the Standby role will always belong to the chassis 2.
Having said that, in order to mitigate the parity errors we can proceed as follows.
1.
Reload or reseat module 2 on switch 1, you can do it without causing any supervisor role change.
2.
Reload or reseat the module 3 on switch 2, then the supervisor on module 4 on switch 2 will take the Standby Hot role.
In the mean time the supervisor on module 3 on switch 2 will boot after some time as the CSSO.
3.
In order to recover the initial setup we need to perform a reload of the standby supervisor.
redundancy reload peer
After that we will have the module 3 on switch 2 as the Standby Hot and again module 4 on switch 2 as the CSSO.
Please let me know if it is clear for you, if so let me know how we can proceed with this service request.

2.
Switch 2 – Does your team suspect any issues with this device?  If unsure, maybe test by stacking in the lab?  If we find issues during testing, then open another SR (let’s not mix it with this SR) and have TAC investigate, then raise RMA.

How ARP handling which trigger the software exception, is related to changes made on the switch with the help of DNAC.
The crash is happening under ARP snoop process where the ARP packet arrives on the interface that was recently reconfigured by DNAC.
While debugging the code and crash core files, the development team found traces for a interface which was recently configured by DNAC.
This was the reason why I was asking if any interface was recently configured/reconfigured.
The present code is recommended by Cisco, why not this issue flagged as caveat during the recommendation.
The current recommended version by Cisco Engineering team is 17.3.3

* DNA Center Assurance feature at this time is focused on high level

Hence detailed
historical event reports are not available to be exported from DNAC
currently.
* We are able to get an availability report, showing the percentage of
uptime of an Access Point, in a given time period.
* This feature is available starting DNAC 2.1.2.x.
* It can be accessed from the reports section under template ""Network
Device Availability"".
* We are able to get the most recent occurrence of when any AP went
down as a report.
* This feature is available in your current DNAC version.
* It can be accessed from the Assurance section > Network issues and
filtered using ""AP down"" or ""AP flap"" issue type.
* However, the availability trends over time are only available on the
DNAC GUI as a graph and is not exportable for executive review.
As
discussed, the event report from Prime Infrastructure is the feature that
can help out here.

My name is Sweta and I will be working closely with you towards resolving this case.
This is currently a P3 case and you have requested to be contacted via e-mail.
Please let me know if the case priority and communication preference agree with you.
I have gone through the case notes and inferred that ISE high Authentication Latency after upgrade.
In order to understand the scenario better, I would appreciate if you could help me with the following:
1.
What is the hardware and software version of products involved?
2.
What time did the issue start?
3.
What changes were made before the issue appeared?
4.
What is the current impact to your network/users/business?
5.
Who is the end customer?
6.
What troubleshooting steps have been tried already?
7.
A topology diagram of the affected site.
I would be truly grateful if you would CC all mails to attach@cisco.com, as this would ensure that they are documented in the case notes automatically.

CoA alerts for multiple endpoints

Last Action Plan:
=================
1.	ISE 3.0 patch-3
2.	Issue: We are getting CoA alerts on the ISE node. 11213 No response received from Network Access Device after sending a Dynamic Authorization request
3.	We have only one WLC in the deployment. 
4.	A guest captive portal has been configured on the WLC (Local Web Authentication LWA). The guest portal on the ISE is also configured. 
5.	On the profiler global settings we have “Reauth” option. So, every time an endpoint is profiled the ISE will send a reauthentication packet the WLC/Switch. Now, on the WLC we didn’t enable NAC State as ISE_NAC, so the WLC drops the CoA packets from the ISE.

The bug which documents this memory leak (https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv16874) also has IOS version 17.3.5 as a fixed release.
Therefore, the next action plan would be to perform an IOS upgrade in order to mitigate the issue.

693656495,emailin,"I am Bhaskar S Jois from CISCO TAC Asia-Pacific LAN Switching team.
I have the ownership of your service request with SR: 693656495.
I will be closely working with you towards the final resolution of this service request.
I have reviewed the case.
Based on the case notes, here is my understanding of the issue.
Problem Description:
C9300 - FE frequent reboot due to high memory utilization.
Action Plan:
I went through the show tech and the logs attached and found the following traceback: -Traceback= 1#2658c6db5c37a000fba2793f7f155189  :558EE3AAD000+6242C57 :558EE3AAD000+621FCBC :558EE3AAD000+625833E :558EE3AAD000+6216FA9 :558EE3AAD000+62C6055 :558EE3AAD000+6307CAD :558EE3AAD000+A2FD500 :558EE3AAD000+6306352 :558EE3AAD000+A2D1140
The decoded version of the trackback is as follows:
1.
0x558ee9cefc57 <BE> sisf_binding_table_reg_client_notify
2.
0x558ee9ccccbc <BE> sisf_bt_statechng_notify

8.
0x558ee9db3352 <BE> sisf_main_thread_dispatcher
9.
0x558eedd7e140 <BE> xos_thread_start_int
Upon looking up the trackback in our internal database, I found a bug which documented the traceback and perfectly matches the scenario: https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw22489.
More detailed information can be found in the original bug: https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu07084.
Conditions: IPv6 running, DNAC configured, AAA configured, VRF configuration and IOS version: 16.12.04
As mentioned in the bug : https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu07084, the workaround can be found in the latest stable IOS version 17.3.5.
Therefore, in order to mitigate the issue, kindly consider an IOS upgrade to 17.3.5 which is the cisco recommended gold star IOS version for C9300 switch.

 Hi,

show interface command shows link and protocol is UP and port light also green however this ports won IP or P2P ip cant ping as well as ospf peer goes down. and in show cdp neig didnt shows any neighbors.

we have done reboot the switch but after reboot for the time being ospf got up however its same after a while. then we have change the port and change the switch stack priority then its become normal.  

we have attached show tac (we collect before reboot) and before after reboot log. please check and confirm the

++ Discussed that issue happened around June 22 3 PM SGT when you found the OSPF was down, its own port IP was not pinging and that switch was not reachable from distribution; while the affected ports were up-up(connected).
 
++ It is a stack of 8 switches and the ports affected were that connected to distribution - Te1/1/8 and Te2/1/8.
 
++ Checked the CPU, memory and logs during issue time and found normal CPU(9%), memory(45%) and no logs for the affected ports.
 
++ You informed that you reseated SFP, bounced ports and reloaded whole stack even however issue persisted.
 
++ You then changed the switch’s priorities and made switch-3 as new active(from switch-1) and switch-4 as new standby(from switch-2). Then you changed the ports:
Te1/1/8 -> Te1/1/6
Te2/1/8 -> Te2/1/6
 
++ Post this, you reloaded switch-1 and switch-2 and issue got resolved and network came up working fine.
 
++ Checked if any capture was taken during issue time, you informed no.
++ Checked if we have syslog server configured to check, you informed no.
 
++ Discussed that we can generate the trace archive and check for logs around issue time and generated it accordingly:
request platform software trace rotate all
request platform software trace archive
 
++ You also informed that you are planning internally to replace the module this Thursday night and requires TAC to be on standby during the activity.
 
++ You replaced the module and updated that switch is working fine since then. You monitored for a week and confirmed to proceed with closure if didn’t hear otherwise.","['17.03.05', '16.09.02', '16.12.01s', '16.12.03s', '16.12.04', '16.06.07', '16.06.08', 'NA - RMA', 'NA - COMPONENT ONLY', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', '3.2.3o', 'PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND', '16.12.3s', '17.6.4', '16.12.3a', '16.12.1s', '16.9.5', '1.0', '16.3.5', '15.0.2']","['C9300-48U-A', 'C9300-48U', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_HW', 'UCS-FI-6454', 'C9300-NM-8X', 'PWR-C1-1100WAC']",16.12.04,C9300-48U,False,False

Please perform the below:
*   I would request to perform this test during off hours, in a maintenance window.
*   Replace PSU1 with a known good power supply on the WLC showing status, “Present, Off”
*   Please note the power supply in 8540 is hot swappable, so just replacing the “Off” one on the secondary chassis and test it with a good power supply.
*   Once tested, kindly check the same on the Standby-WLC as well, collect the below outputs:
*   show imm chassis power-supply
*   show version
*   show imm chassis current.
As the power supply is hot-swappable, always keep at least 1 power supply connected to the WLC to prevent switchover.

    } Action Taken :-
 * Informed you that we have discussed about your requirement with the development team and below is the solution provided by them . 
* ISE endpoint API to get all endpoints; has the option to filter; one of the filters is groupId. So, the customers may get the groupId using ISE endpointgroup API and then use that as the filter. 
* GET; /ers/config/endpoint; * ;
 * Get all endpoints Implementation Notes This API allows the client to get all the endpoints. Filter: Filters can be used to filter out Endpoints based on a set of attributes. This API currently provides the following filters: [logicalProfileName, portalUser, staticProfileAssignment, profileId, profile, groupId, staticGroupAssignment, mac] 
* You informed that you will try to implement the suggested solution and will get back to us if you have any queries regarding this .
* Got a confirmation from your side that the query fulfilled the requirement and we are good for the case closure .",['3.0.0'],['SNS-3655-K9'],3.0.0,SNS-3655-K9,False,False

=====================


  *   Multiple devices compliance error state.
  *   Manual resync didn’t help and the last resync was 17 hours ago.
  *   No error noticed on provisioning logs
  *   We manually re-ran compliance as a workaround for few devices and suggested to follow the same process for other devices.
  *   TAC reviewed the logs and reached out to BU/DE
  *   During this process, all the devices were fixed without any intervention.
  *   DE’s were unable to root cause the issue with the RCA’s provided after upgrade.
  *   Obtained older RCA’s which was collected before upgrade and the DB logs which were requested by the DE
  *   DE root caused the issue with the following error which was found in the previous version.

Problem Details: 1) Is it possible to monitor the performance of vCMX such as CPU, Memory, Disk usage by using Solarwinds or Cisco Prime Infra? We are using Solarwinds/PI to monitor the health of other cisco devices such as switches/ISEs. Solarwinds/PI monitor those devices by using snmp polling/traps.

2) As per the cisco document, CMX can display Alerts (in gui System > Alerts page) and send out Alert Emails. We want to know the threshold values of Waring, Minor, Major, and Critical Alerts for CPU, Memory, Disk, Swap usage.

3) Will CMX send out alert email if a process's CPU usage exceed 100%? For example, java process 2970 reached 512.5% and java process 18466 reached 206.2% when checking with top command. Refer to below top output. In this kind of situation, will cmx send out alert emails?

When java process 2970's CPU usage reached 512.5%, in GUI System Dashboard, CPU usage was shown as about 20%, meaning 80% CPU is free to use.

++ As per the show tech, I can see that total system memory is available 3 GB and system is using above 2.5 GB memory, there is only near about 400 MB system memory remaining on the switch.
      This can be impacting the performance of the switch and will might cause unexpected reload in future.

Action Plan :
++ The previous Engineer checked the show tech file and saw that there were some alarms related to memory leakage.
++ We could see this switch is running on 16.03.06 which is a bit old IOS code and vulnerable to memory leakage.
++ You can plan IOS upgrade to fix the memory leakage problem.
++ As per below link : https://software.cisco.com/download/home/284850616/type/282046477/release/Fuji-16.9.4?catid=268438038
     16.9.4 is latest IOS codes for this platform.
      If you don’t want to install Smart Licensing, then 16.6.7 would be the recommended code.
++ If you want to particularly check for which process is taking up the utilization before upgrade, we can do that.
++ We would recommend you to grab following CLI outputs from the suspicious switch, every 2-3 hours for 2 day and send across.

Thank you. Hi TAC team,

Our customer has logged a crash on their ASA FW and have sent over the crashinfo logs.

Kindly assist us in going through the logs and finding the cause of the crash

Thank you. Based on the show tech, I can see that CPU, memory are good. All the interfaces are up. All processes are running fine.
CPU utilization for 5 seconds = 15%; 1 minute: 12%; 5 minutes: 12%
Free memory:       11955556008 bytes (83%)
 
Your ASA doesn’t have coredump file ‘coredumpfsys’ in its flash.
 
After examining the crashinfo,  I understand your device running ASA 9.14(2)15 crashed on 2021-09-06 due to bug CSCvy48159 https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvy48159  - ASA Traceback & reload on process name Lina due to memory header validation.
 
Workaround-
Disabling threat detection at the CLI will prevent this crash, but doing so may trigger a second crash (also covered under this defect ID). Therefore the following is recommended:

For Standalone setups:
> Save the config of the device (do not perform any further changes until all steps below described are followed)
> Retrieve startup config from affected device
> Remove ""threat-detection"" lines from retrieved file
> Upload new file to flash of device
> Copy the config from the file to the startup config: 
copy flash:/ startup-config
> Reload the device
 
Permanent fix-
You can upgrade the device to version 9.14.3 which is a known fixed release as per the bug page.","['ASA', 'FPHIGH', '6.0.0.1005', 'CISCO FIREPOWER', '964.3', '9.14.3', '9.8.4.7', '9.8.2', '9.12.4', '9.14.2.15', '9.14.2.4', '9.8.1', '9.8.3']","['FPR9K-SM-24', 'FPR9K-SUP', 'FPR-C9300-AC', 'FPR9K-ACK', 'FS4000-K9', 'FPR-9300-E-K9', 'ASA5506-SSD', 'FPR9K-SM-36=', 'ASA5506-K9', 'FPR2130-ASA-K9']",9.14.2.15,FPR2130-ASA-K9,False,True

Problem Details: ISE 2.3  RADIUS Accounting - Interim update - Endpoint IP address and MAC address missing ISE 2.3  RADIUS Accounting - Interim update - Endpoint IP address and MAC address missing As discussed :


  1.  It is expected to see some Accounting Start packets not having an IP address as accounting start packets are sent as soon as the user is authenticated irrespective of whether or not the user got an IP address. It so can happen that the user may get an IP address after a second or so and not immediately after the authentication and in such cases, the accounting start may not have an IP address.
  2.  It sometimes can so happen that the interim updates may also miss an IP address. This happens when the DHCP lease time expires and the end device has to renew its lease or when the endpoint moves from one AP to another AP and mistakes it for a network change and refreshes IP etc.
  3.  Having said point number 2. Only one 2 such interim updates per user per endpoint can be expected. Eventually that user/endpoint should get an IP address and should be available in the subsequent interim updates. It cannot happen that such an endpoint doesn’t get an IP for the entire day if it still has an active session and connected to the network.

Also, Accounting is not a 100% full proof method to take any security measures in a network and one should not rely solely on that for the above mentioned reasons and also especially because of the fact that these syslogs are sent over an unsecure medium to start with and anyone can tamper with them.

Sharing the below document for the same.

https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/firepower-ngfw/212321-clarify-the-firepower-threat-defense-acc.html

Note: In order for the Snort engine to determine the application it has to inspect a few packets (usually 3-10 which depends on the application decoder). Thus a few packets are allowed through the FTD and they make it to the destination. The allowed packets are still subject to the Intrusion Policy check based on the Access Policy > Advanced >  'Intrusion Policy used before Access Control rule is determined' option.



Every intrusion event which is generated on the device is because of the content match which is mentioned in the SID.

As far as log4j is concerned we have the SIDs to block the malicious traffic through the device. If you could share the captures I can analyze it further.

As you can see ,
the no of deployed nodes = 15
The no of live nodes = 10

Hence it indicates that 5 nodes were marked dead on the PAN, to which replication was not happening.

As you can see the above nodes are had not been responding for the time duration mentioned, this means they have been marked dead or out of sync for that much amount of time. The initial trigger happened much before which might have pushed them out of sync and eventually must have marked them dead. However, I do not see any trigger in the attached logs, since they were already out of sync much before 24th as they were not responding to the primary node. More so, the debugs were not enabled , and hence the root cause might not have been captured.

The last log observed from the support bundle was from 2019-04-26 23:59:48. Around this time we can observe only 1 node has come up, and in total 11 are Live nodes out of the 15 nodes in deployment. More so , we can see HSDC-EDU-NAC-01 came alive, and started responding to it and hence for this node, the replication as in progress. However as mentioned before, since the debugs and the exact timestamp is not known, we cannot determine the trigger here which caused them to fall out of sync and eventually mark them as dead on the PAN node.

At this point after exhausting all the resources, I believe something in the network might have blocked the communication between the nodes, or a firewall might have blocked communication, or it could be any other trigger causing the communication between the PAN and these affected nodes to fail, due to which PAN might have marked them as dead. But since debugs were not enabled and we aren’t aware of the of the exact timestamp, we cannot determine the root cause or the trigger.

Going forward, I would suggest you to make sure that nothing in your network ( ex- firewall, network slowness etc) might be interfering between internode communications. Since these nodes might be at different sites, it is highly probable that something in your network might have blocked the internode communication.

However, if this is a frequent issue, we can discuss the possibility of enabling the debugs on ISE, which would help us capture the root trigger, in case the issue happens again.

Problem Details: We want to monitor the radar detection in our WLAN. Can we get these logs from the WLC? Specifically when an AP resets its channel because of a radar. Thanks We want to monitor the radar detection in our WLAN. Can we get these logs from the WLC? Specifically when an AP resets its channel because of a radar. Thanks - As discussed, you can check Radar detection from AP side. Also, we can check the Radar activity from WLC by checking traplog.
- Confirmed that it is possible to send AP logs to a configured syslog server with two conditions as follows:
1-  Since DFS message has the informational level ""6"", the syslog level on the WLC configuration for syslog server should be informational and not any less level 
2- In addition, we should configure it Globally or by specific AP using the below commands:
Globally: config ap syslog host global <syslog IP >
Specific AP: config ap syslog host specific <ap name> <ip address>

- Then, you can check the configuration before and after issuing the command by using the following show command:
WLC> show ap config global

-   As per our discussion, the only way to send the radar logs for the syslog server is to configure the mentioned commands. Since it will cause heavy load on syslog server, you can open enhancement request which would be evaluated by BU to allow the possibility for enabling/ disabling the messages in msglogs like the traps.

- Since all of your concerns are clear now, you've requested to close the case as no further assistance is needed.","['WLC RRM/RF/CLEANAIR', 'WLC CLIENT INTEROP', '8.3.140.0', '802.11AC', '9.8.2.166.0', '9.8.3.143.0', 'NA-CIN_CLOSE_SW', 'NA - COMPONENT ONLY', '9.8.5.151.0', '9.8.3.150.0', '9.8.5.160.0', '9.8.10.130.0', '9.8.10.162.0', '9.8.10.151.0', '9.8.5.171.0', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', '9.8.5.140.0', '9.8.10.171.0', '9.8.5.135.0', '4.0.1a', '8.10.185.0', '8.10.171.0', '120.13', '8.10.183.0', '8.3.131.0', '17.3.5b', '8.10.151.0', '8.10.161.0', '12.0.13', '8.10.150.0', '1.0', '8.10.130.0', '8.3.150.0', '8.5.161.0', '8.5.135.0', '8.5.171.0', '8.5.140.0', '8.3.143.0', '8.4', '16.12.4', '16.12.3s']","['AIR-CT8540-1K-K9', 'AIR-CT8540-K9', 'NA-CIN_CLOSE_HW', 'C9120AXI-S', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_HW', 'AIR-CT8540-CA-K9', 'AIR-AP2802I-S-K9', 'AIR-CT8540-K9Z', 'AIR-BZL-C240M4', 'DN2-HW-APL-XL', 'WLC-AP-T', 'AIR-CT8540-SW-8.2']",8.4,AIR-CT8540-SW-8.2,False,False

For this particular subnet, the L2 border seems not forwarding the arp requests and hence client in the same vlan are not able to communicate. looks like the traffic is not forwarded to the 6800 on the po20

from the packet capture we see that ARP flooding is happening on the outgoing interface of po20 but not seen on the 6800

Problem Details: we could not change AP Group name in DNAC version 2.3.3.7.
DNAC had been upgraded to version 2.3.3.7 recently form 2.2.2.9.
in version 2.2.2.9, we were able to change AP Group name by following the steps provided by cisco tac in tac case 694667569 - DNAC - zone prefix is not appended to the AP group name. ""re-name the site and do a resync to WLC.""
we tried to do the same in DNAC version 2.3.3.7 but DNAC is using the old/wrong site/floor name when trying to resync.
APs were provisioned with the 'wrong site/floor name', example, floor name - wrong-name-01, wrong-name-02, then AP groups became wrong-name-01-xxx, wrong-name-02-xxx.
after that we changed to correct site name and the correct floor map names are  correct-name-01, correct-name-02. after the name changed, we selected the APs and tried to resync with wlc, but the Dnac Preview showed that DNAC was still pushing the config using the old/wrong name for the AP group name like wrong-name-01-xxx. dnac should be using the updated new name and ap group should change to correct-name-01-xxx  when resync to wlc.

We can update AP Group name in DNAC version 2.2.2.9 but in version 2.3.3.7 AP Group name cannot be updated.
Is there another way to update AP Group name in dnac 2.3.3.7?
Or is it a bug? we could not change AP Group name in DNAC version 2.3.3.7.

Or is it a bug? You wanted to know if there is way to change the AP group name by DNAC automatically whenever there is sitename change 

We changed one site name and then generated config preview of both WLC and AP we didn’t see any config change .the config preview loaded to be empty . 

We checked internally and found that there is no way that DNAC can change the AP group name automatically . We cando it manually 

We can create a new AP group name  by Going into Network profile.

Select the wireless profile where the these AP is present in the site . Under that there is advanced settings and we can create the AP group 

 
 
We can then try to generate config preview and then see the AP group getting created","['2.3.3.7.72328', '2.3.3.6']",['DN2-HW-APL-XL'],2.3.3.6,DN2-HW-APL-XL,False,False

Problem Description: 
- DNAC Wireless Assurance health score shows 0 after May 15 9:00 PM SGT.
- Issue seen after provisioning the WLC.
- **Provisioning time:** May 15 @ 12:53 UTC.

Setup Info:
- DNAC version: 2.3.3.7
- WLC we are focusing:
    - **Hostname:** TLDC-WL-WLC01
    - **IP:** 172.18.240.13
    - **HW/SW:** AIR-CT8540-K9 / 8.10.183.0

Tshoot/Analysis:
-	We have seen that Wireless assurance is missing in DNAC since around May 15 9:00 PM SGT.
-	Checking WLC configuration we see that it is disabled.
-	Checking DNAC site settings we see that Wireless telemetry is disabled.
-	We also observed that around 8:53 PM SGT, the WLC was provisioned as part of another activity.
-	Suspect that the WLC was provisioned with Wireless telemetry disabled as per the site settings configured in DNAC.
-	However, the audit log details, or configuration preview do not indicate that wireless assurance was disabled.
-	You forced pushed the telemetry settings to WLC [172.18.240.13]  during MW on 20 May. However that does not seem to enable the WSA service on the WLC.
-	On further analysis, identified following defects which have been root caused to CSCvk62901 libssh2 library upgrade for WLC 
CSCvq42714 WLC WSA service is disabled after discovery and provisioning due to which it says unmonitored
CSCvp20941 Assurance configs are not getting pushed to WLC.
-	engaged Sudhanshu from WLC team who validated this in lab and it was working as expected.
-	In order to further isolate the issue and he requested following details.
o	Save the putty session of WLC and run the below debugs on WLC.
show logging config-history
debug emweb web enable
debug pm pki enable
o	Trigger the issue by doing 'Update Telemetry Settings' --> ""Force Configuration push"" from DNAC.
o	  After running the above debugs commands on WLC and triggering the issue from DNAC, wait for 10 min to collect the outputs on WLC, then close the SSH session and share the file.
o	  From DNAC side, upload the RCA file.
