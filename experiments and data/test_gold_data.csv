The above logs indicates, the issue could be from the Redundant Port connection between Active and Standby so the result in XML file sync up failed and Master timeout.
As per the information on call, the Redundant Port is not back to back connection and the connection on through distributed switches.
As per the recommendation from Cisco , the RP connection needs to be connected directly between two controllers as a permanent solution.
Please Refer > https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/8-7/High_Availability_DG.html#pgfId-91515
As you have provided the bug CSCvq95397, it is also related to RP connection issue and it was on Unreproduceable state due to the RP connection is not back to back.
Next Plan of Action:
For time being, if the RP connection is coming UP and there is a proper RP communication, Please try the following action
Please bring down the RP port before doing the below action;
1.
Need to bring down the RP Port
2.
Make the reachability to mgmt IP address for Standby controller (Unique IP)
3.
Disable the port connection and HA SSO
4.
Reload the standby controller
5.
Bring UP the standby as standalone controller.
6.
Reconfigure the HA SSO with RP interface UP.
7.
If the above steps are failed, Please change the switch port of RP connection.
8.
Permanent solution to connect RP back to Back.

Problem Details: We found UP link is UP but switch was unreachable. OSPF was down. uplink ports shows green light. service also get down. We found UP link is UP but switch was unreachable. OSPF was down. uplink ports shows green light. service also get down. +++ As per logs. I don’t see any error related to behaviour we observed on the switch .
+++ Ideally such behaviour could have been result of memory leak, switch getting stuck in state, hardware programming error , or any unknown bugs.
+++ Since we had reloaded without collecting logs which needed to pin point such cases , we will not be able to proceed further .
+++ My best suggestion here would be to upgrade the Switch to latest stable code so that we can avoid any old known issue on 16.12.3.

Below is latest Stable Cisco Suggested code for this Switch ,

Problem Description: 
- DNAC Wireless Assurance health score shows 0 after May 15 9:00 PM SGT.
- Issue seen after provisioning the WLC.
- **Provisioning time:** May 15 @ 12:53 UTC.

Setup Info:
- DNAC version: 2.3.3.7
- WLC we are focusing:
    - **Hostname:** TLDC-WL-WLC01
    - **IP:** 172.18.240.13
    - **HW/SW:** AIR-CT8540-K9 / 8.10.183.0

Tshoot/Analysis:
-	We have seen that Wireless assurance is missing in DNAC since around May 15 9:00 PM SGT.
-	Checking WLC configuration we see that it is disabled.
-	Checking DNAC site settings we see that Wireless telemetry is disabled.
-	We also observed that around 8:53 PM SGT, the WLC was provisioned as part of another activity.
-	Suspect that the WLC was provisioned with Wireless telemetry disabled as per the site settings configured in DNAC.
-	However, the audit log details, or configuration preview do not indicate that wireless assurance was disabled.
-	You forced pushed the telemetry settings to WLC [172.18.240.13]  during MW on 20 May. However that does not seem to enable the WSA service on the WLC.
-	On further analysis, identified following defects which have been root caused to CSCvk62901 libssh2 library upgrade for WLC 
CSCvq42714 WLC WSA service is disabled after discovery and provisioning due to which it says unmonitored
CSCvp20941 Assurance configs are not getting pushed to WLC.
-	engaged Sudhanshu from WLC team who validated this in lab and it was working as expected.
-	In order to further isolate the issue and he requested following details.
o	Save the putty session of WLC and run the below debugs on WLC.
show logging config-history
debug emweb web enable
debug pm pki enable
o	Trigger the issue by doing 'Update Telemetry Settings' --> ""Force Configuration push"" from DNAC.
o	  After running the above debugs commands on WLC and triggering the issue from DNAC, wait for 10 min to collect the outputs on WLC, then close the SSH session and share the file.
o	  From DNAC side, upload the RCA file.

-	As per your last update,
Telemetry Settings for wlc01 had been updated on 4th of July and assurance got enabled for that WLC since then.
-	As per your request we monitored the status by end of the week and did not receive any further issues reported.","['1.3.3.7', '2.2.3.6', '16.12.04', '2.3.3.6', '2.3.3.7.72323', '2.3.3.7', '2.1.2.7', '2.3.3.7.72328', '2.3.3.4', '2.2.2.9']",2.3.3.7,DN2-HW-APL-XL,True,TYPE3

Description automatically generated
 
The RCA Logs were generated after the failure for further investigation
The BU Escalation Team were involved and after analysis the Root Cause was identified as seen below :
 
Issue triggered due to duplication data in DB, resulting in Network Programmer running out of memory​.
CSCwf89617 is addressed in 2.3.3.7. The fix is applicable only for WLC provisioning flows done after upgrading to 2.3.3.7.
The duplicated data is present in database prior to the Upgrade to 2.3.3.7
new defect CSCwd49629 is raised to handle the old stale entries in DB which might be carried forward after during upgrade to 2.3.3.7 and which are not handled by CSCwf89617.
 
The Workaround that was provided to resolve this issue is as follows :
 
Prune the DCS table to nullify the data, to clear the duplicated data​.
Increase memory of network-programmer and spf-service​
 
Subsequent sessions involved applying the workaround and provisioning the WLC’s which all resulted in success.","['2.2.3.6', '2.3.3.7', '2.2.2.9']",2.3.3.7,DN2-HW-APL-XL,True,TYPE3

Action Plan:
To assist me with investigating this issue, are you able to please provide information/confirmation on the below points:
1.
Do all devices exhibit this behaviour ? What is the show run of this switch ? What are the last provisioning done for this device ?
2.
Is DNAC single node or three node cluster and what is the current version of DNAC?
3.
Which interface was configured here ?
4.
Any recent changes post which this has been observed ? Since when did this start ?
5.
Please collect and upload a RCA file to case
(For generation you need to just enter the command “rca “  one by one on all nodes and then extract from the DNAC refer section Extract the RCA file on a Windows computer in below document)
Reference 'How to Generate and Extract Root Cause Analysis (RCA) file from Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Center.':  https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/cloud-systems-management/dna-center/213926-how-to-generate-and-extract-root-cause-a.html

Could you please confirm if you have collected both file during the issue ?
**********************
During high CPU
Please proceed to enable debugs in ISE GUI from PAN: Navigate to Administration > System> Logging>Debug log configuration and choose the node ( Affected node)
On the list showing up on the screen you have to choose one by one this debugs:
•        Admin-infra
•        Infrastructure
•        Then you have to change the Level, so change from INFO/WARN and select DEBUG and then click save, do the same for each one.
•        Wait for some minutes to capture the errors, around 10-15 minutes.
•        Next then go to Operations > Troubleshoot > Download Logs > choose the node and click on support bundle, click on the options: include debug logs, include local logs, include monitoring and reporting logs, and include system logsto generate the file, choose today's date in the from/to options, choose public encryption key and click on create support bundle, once it is finished you can downloaded and include it on the case.
•        Then go again to Administration > System> Logging>Debug log>click button from node were support bundle was taken and click RESET TO DEFAULT to turn off the debugs.
Support Bundle from CLI: If needed, if not with GUI its enough.
Follow steps #1 and #2 from above, once issue has been recreated access to affected node CLI and run the following command: # backup-logs (name of the file) repository (name of the repository) public-key.
Heap Dumps and Thread Dumps:
Thread Dumps:
This information needs to be collected while the issue is experienced.
If not, it will be of no use at all.
We have to collect thread dump for at least 4 to 5 times one per each 5-10 seconds.
Go to Affected Node CLI run #application configure ise and select option 23.
Heap Dumps:
Before we start collecting heap dumps, we need to run the following API on a web browser:https://<ISE ipor FQDN>/admin/stats/perf/profilerJMX.jsp?service=JMXStart
Then go to affected node CLI run #application configure ise, select option 22.
Once the heap dump collection is finished, we need to run the following API:https://<ISE ip or FQDN>/admin/stats/perf/profilerJMX.jsp?service=JMXStop","['3.0.0.458', '2.7.0.356', '3.0.0.448', '3.0.0']",2.7.0.356,SNS-3655-K9,False,NOTTYPE3

For example: We use SNS-3655-K9, which has 24 CPU_Cores, and the middle value has not exceeded 24, which indicates load is normal and you correctly noted this during our last conversation.
Additionally, let me explain how ISE memory utilization works:
ISE runs on Linux OS.
Linux caches files in memory in order to reduce access times.
These files can remain cached for extended periods of time.
Newer versions of RedHat Linux manage memory differently than earlier versions.
It is common to see high memory usage and swap usage even if there is no contention for memory.
If your ISE system is not generating alarms for high swap/load, then that means ISE has enough memory available.
Unless there are any performance related changes on ISE like GUI comparatively slower than before and If ISE has not generated any alarms, then we can deduce that ISE has enough memory available.
ISE has its own alarms for high memory/load/swap utilization that should trigger if it matches the criteria.
Please let me know how you'd like to proceed further with this case.","['3.0.0.458', '2.7.0.356', '3.0.0.448', '3.0.0']",2.7.0.356,SNS-3655-K9,False,NOTTYPE3

Initial issue:
When we had more number of clients connected to the APs(around 70-80 clients), few of them stopped catering to clients and after a reboot clients connected fine. The crash was generated after rebooting the Aps to restore the network.

You had a fabric setup with over 4000+ Aps.

Here is a brief summary of our call:
1. You had 4-5 Ap crashes which were 2802i AP modes and we collected the crash logs and tech support logs from the affected APs.
2. Since you wanted SDA team to look into the fabric part to figure out if the are any issues with the routing part, I involved my SDA team on call.
3. As per our SDA teams analysis, the fabric underlaying path is not a traditional design and my colleague will give you more details about his findings and next plan of action.","['1.0', '8.10.151.0', '8.10.171.0', '802.11AC', '8.5.171.0', '8.10.183.0', '8.10.130.0', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', '8.5.135.0', '8.3.143.0', 'NA-CIN_CLOSE_SW', '8.5.140.0', '4.0.1a', 'WLC CLIENT INTEROP', '12.0.13', '8.5.151.0', '8.4', '120.13', '8.5.160.0', '8.3.131.0', '8.3.150.0', '8.5.161.0', '8.10.185.0', '8.2.166.0', '16.12.3s', 'WLC RRM/RF/CLEANAIR', 'NA - COMPONENT ONLY', '8.10.162.0', '8.3.140.0', '8.10.150.0', '8.10.161.0', '16.12.4', '17.3.5b']",8.10.185.0,AIR-AP2802I-S-K9,False,NOTTYPE3

Garbage collector usage in RHEL: As long as an object is being referenced, the JVM considers it alive. Once an object is no longer referenced and therefore is not reachable by the application code, the garbage collector removes it and reclaims the unused memory. The reason GC is using more CPU cycles is that its aggressively reclaiming a huge amount of Objects which are not referenced anymore.

From the Catalina.out file we could see also the VCS threads being blocked:

Because of the above observations we see that you are encountering the bug CSCwd45843<https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd45843>;. There is a hotfix available for this bug:
https://software.cisco.com/download/home/283801620/type/283802505/release/HP-CSCwd45843

This is a generic HP and can be applied on any version and is available in CCO site, you could install it on all the nodes and monitor.

But we would suggests to install patch 6 first and then install this HP.

This bug is addressed in ISE 3.0 p7 which is yet to be released, until then you can install patch 6 first and then the HP over it.","['3.0.0.458', '2.7.0.356', '3.0.0.448', '3.0.0']",3.0.0.458,SNS-3655-K9,False,NOTTYPE3

We have reloaded the device last night.
The CPU load dropped down and GUI loading is faster.
We will monitor the stability.
Meanwhile, I need your help on below points:
*   I uploaded the support bundle taken before the reload, which will have the thread dump as well (already uploaded the heap dump).
Please help to analyze the same and share us the findings.
*   I will also generate another support bundle with thread dump next Wednesday/Thursday for analysis.
Just to confirm, whether the garbage collector thread is still an issue and whether we need to implement the hotfix or not.","['3.0.0.458', '2.7.0.356', '3.0.0.448', '3.0.0']",3.0.0.458,SNS-3655-K9,False,NOTTYPE3

Thank you for contacting Cisco Technical Support.
My name is Nadia Gouveia from AAA-APAC Team and I will be working closely with you towards resolving this case.
This is currently a P2 case and you have requested to be contacted email.
I have gone through the case notes and inferred that - You are facing high load average on the ISE PAN node
You are on ISE 3.0 p3.
From the case notes I see JSVC and Java process are utilising high CPU in the setup.
To understand reason for the high cpu usage we need to take logs from the ISE nodes.
I see you have requested for a call at 11:30 Am IST today.
Let me know if there is any change in the time for the session.
I would be truly grateful if you would CC all mails to attach@cisco.com<mailto:attach@cisco.com>  , as this would ensure that they are documented in the case notes automatically.","['3.0.0.458', '2.7.0.356', '3.0.0.448', '3.0.0']",3.0.0.458,SNS-3655-K9,False,NOTTYPE3

________________________________
Hi VJ,

We have got the clarity on the case to adjust session timeout. We are into discussion for adoption of this workaround.

My ask on last call was to share the delete reasons known from such issues for sda and non sda client connectivity environment.

This is still pending from Karnam. Once this info is provided. Please proceed with closure.

Punt-policer is enabled by default, and it polices all the control plane punted traffic. When traffic for a specific punt cause exceeds the configured value, the packets will be dropped, and a log message printed, punt policer is enabled to control the CPU from becoming overwhelmed. Currently the high priority traffic threshold is 5000 
As we see the high priority packets are dropped, we can increase the threshold to 15000 and see if there is any drops. ( this can be applied later after getting the logs from debugs)

BGP router process,  Calculates the best BGP path and processes any route churn. It also sends and receives routes, establishes peers, and interacts with the routing information base (RIB).
To get more details we need to enable debugs on the router.

Increase Interface Input Queues
If BGP advertises thousands of routes to many peers, TCP must transmit thousands of packets in a short duration. The BGP peers receive these packets and send TCP acknowledgements to the BGP speaker that advertises, which causes the BGP speaker to receive a flood of TCP ACKs in a short period of time. If the ACKs arrive at a rate that is too high for the route processor, packets back up in inbound interface queues. By default, router interfaces use an input queue size of 75 packets. In addition, special control packets such as BGP UPDATES use a special queue with Selective Packet Discard (SPD). This special queue holds 100 packets. When BGP convergence, happens TCP ACKs can fill quickly the 175 spots of input buffering and the new packets that arrive must be dropped. On routers with 15 or more BGP peers and exchange of the full Internet routing table, over 10,000 drops per interface per minute can be seen. Here is example output from a router 15 minutes after reboot:
Router#show interface pos 8/0 | include input queue
Output queue 0/40, 0 drops; input queue 0/75, 278637 drops
Router#
If you increase the interface input queue depth (with the hold-queue in command) it helps reduce the number of dropped TCP ACKs, which reduces the amount of work BGP must do to converge. Normally, a value of 1000 resolves problems caused by input queue drops.

These are described in below doc and matches the issue we are seeing, there could be some peers which are advertising the routes in continuous interval.
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/107615-highcpu-bgp.html

To identify the packets that is causing the CPU spike, we need to enable the below debugs, please note these debugs can be run during the production and non-service impacting. 

Conft 
Ip access list extended TAC
Permit ip any any 

debug platform condition ipv4 access-list TAC both
debug platform packet-trace packet 8192 circular fia-trace
debug platform packet-trace punt code 11
debug platform packet-trace copy packet both size 256 L3

once the punt logs are observed please run the below commands and share the tac.txt file for further analysis.  
show platform packet-trace statistics | app tac.txt
show platform packet-trace summary | app tac.txt 
show platform packet-trace packet all | app tac.txt  ( wait for some time for router to copy all the packets )
show platform hardware qfp active infrastructure punt config cause 11 | app tac.txt
show platform software punt-policer drop-only | app tac.txt

Punt-policer is enabled by default, and it polices all the control plane punted traffic. When traffic for a specific punt cause exceeds the configured value, the packets will be dropped, and a log message printed, punt policer is enabled to control the CPU from becoming overwhelmed. Currently the high priority traffic threshold is 5000 
As we see the high priority packets are dropped, we can increase the threshold to 15000 and see if there is any drops. ( this can be applied later after getting the logs from debugs)

In addition, please configure this command to monitor which process is taking the more CPU load. 
process cpu threshold type total rising 90 interval 5 falling 50 intervals 5

Kindly refer the attach output.
From the WLC IOS we noticed the PSU 1 is status as showing Present, Off.
But On the Cisco CIMC its showing that PSU 2 is failing with error alerts
For PSU 2.
we have tried to reseat, change the power source cables and module however on the WLC the status is still showing the same.
Physically checks both PSU unit LED status are green.
In this case we had the PSU 2 slot removed, by right WLC IOS status should be showing as absent, off or even WLC will be power down but this is not happening.
Please advise if this is due to bug.
and what is the best approach on how we can proceed tshoot to resolve the issue.","['1.0', '8.10.151.0', '8.10.171.0', '802.11AC', '8.5.171.0', '8.10.183.0', '8.10.130.0', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', '8.5.135.0', '8.3.143.0', 'NA-CIN_CLOSE_SW', '8.5.140.0', '4.0.1a', 'WLC CLIENT INTEROP', '12.0.13', '8.5.151.0', '8.4', '120.13', '8.5.160.0', '8.3.131.0', '8.3.150.0', '8.5.161.0', '8.10.185.0', '8.2.166.0', '16.12.3s', 'WLC RRM/RF/CLEANAIR', 'NA - COMPONENT ONLY', '8.10.162.0', '8.3.140.0', '8.10.150.0', '8.10.161.0', '16.12.4', '17.3.5b']",8.10.183.0,AIR-CT8540-CA-K9,False,TYPE3

Workaround –
a. Clear device-tracking database mac <>
b. Device-tracking database binding vlan <vlan no > <svi ip> interface vlan <vlan no> <mac>
Or
c. Upgrade to fixed release.
2. CSCvm86310  Since there were some DT entries pointing to 0000.0000.00fd mac
Unfortunately there is no workaround for this. I checked for customer cases where this issue was hit and the clearing device-tracking/ resetting the SVI resolved the issue.","['NA - COMPONENT ONLY', '16.12.3s', '2.3.3.3', '17.6.4', '16.12.4', '2.2.2.5', '1.3.3.6', '16.12.03s', '16.12.01s', '16.12.1s', '2.2.3.3', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', '1.3.3.7', '1.3.3.9', '2.3.3.7', '2.1.2.7', '2.2.3.6', '17.06.02']",16.12.4,C9300-48U-A,False,NOTTYPE3

1)  This could be either no bogus mac addresses being sent from PC to switch during capture
2)  To rule this out, when the issue re-occurs, please perform a simultaneous capture on the switch and PC. 
        a.  Run the mac count command on the switch multiple times to show the mac addresses are incrementing. 
         b.  As workaround we tested by setting a client connected interface on one the switch from mult-auth to single-auth
                    i.  You may follow this during the next occurrence of the mac increments are spiking the CPU.

1)  This could be either no bogus mac addresses being sent from PC to switch during capture
2)  To rule this out, when the issue re-occurs, please perform a simultaneous capture on the switch and PC. 
        a.  Run the mac count command on the switch multiple times to show the mac addresses are incrementing. 
         b.  As workaround we tested by setting a client connected interface on one the switch from mult-auth to single-auth

+6590129432 * Logs indicating Standby was rebooting due to due to RP link latency try increasing the HA timers configure on your WLC, and check if the issue still persist.

Please find the process below to achieve the same:
Via GUI:
Controller > Redundancy > Global Configuration >
Keep Alive Timer: 500-800 millisecond.
Keep Alive Retries:  8-10 retries.

Via CLI:
(Cisco Controller) >config redundancy timer keep-alive-timer <timer msecs>
(Cisco Controller) >config redundancy retries keep-alive-retry <retry count>

* We can test connecting both WLC back to back and test if issue arises again, I understand it won’t be convenient but to conclude it to be a hardware issue we need to test the behavior by connecting both WLC back to back (or keeping max distance to 100 meters as we know: A direct physical connection between Active and Standby Redundant Ports is highly recommended. The distance between the connections can go up to 100 meters at per Ethernet cable standards.

  *   We can monitor the frequency of issue > Accordingly we can predict the next trigger for the issue so we can check the L1 connectivity (where the packets are getting dropped) also as previously suggested Work with your network team to traverse the entire topology between the wireless controllers and check all network devices in the path to verify that the WLC RP VLAN is not added as an SVI on any of these.

Next Action plan was shared:

1. Work with your network team to traverse the entire topology between the wireless controllers and check all network devices in the path to verify that the WLC RP VLAN is not added as an SVI on any of these. We will further have to validate that only the WLC mac-address is being learnt on the VLAN on all network devices which can be confirmed by taking a ‘show mac-address table’ output from all the intermediate switches.
2. Another recommendation by the internal team is to disable the ‘Gateway reachability check’ under WLC->Controller->Redundancy. By disabling this feature, we can confirm if the issue arises due to intermittent reachability loss of the standby to its gateway. If that is the cause, then disabling the feature will not lead to any further reboots of the WLC. However, if the WLC reboots post disabling this feature, then we can ignore this cause. Please note that this test can best be confirmed when the issue is frequent. As I understand from our last call, the WLC has been stable for over the past 4 months, hence to get the best results, perform this test when issue has resurfaced. Also, note that disabling this feature will cause a reboot of the controllers, so please plan to make this change during a downtime.

Cu to update if they have tried disabling the gateway reachability check and post changes what was the observation","['1.0', '8.10.151.0', '8.10.171.0', '802.11AC', '8.5.171.0', '8.10.183.0', '8.10.130.0', 'THIRD_PARTY_PRODUCT_SW', '8.5.135.0', '8.3.143.0', 'NA-CIN_CLOSE_SW', '8.5.140.0', '4.0.1a', 'WLC CLIENT INTEROP', '12.0.13', '8.5.151.0', '8.4', '120.13', '8.5.160.0', '8.3.131.0', '8.3.150.0', '8.5.161.0', '8.10.185.0', '8.2.166.0', '16.12.3s', 'WLC RRM/RF/CLEANAIR', 'NA - COMPONENT ONLY', '8.10.162.0', '8.3.140.0', '8.10.150.0', '8.10.161.0', '16.12.4', '17.3.5b']",8.10.183.0,AIR-CT8540-K9,False,NOTTYPE3

  *   The two faults are, the process misses 3 HBs with remote XR VM, and Sysadmin VM on the remote card is down too. In case of such double failure, rvm_mgr takes action of reloading the remote card as a recovery mechanism.
  *   The connectivity failure between the cards was further confirmed from the below ping report, when the first HB is missed with XR VM, ping test is recorded.
  *   If ping result says 100% packet loss, this means there is communication failure.

  *   The node is stable for 25 days, if there is any sort of hardware failure we should see recurrence but that didn't happen.
