# Welcome to Luna ðŸ”®

### Step 0. Prepare Environment
```shell
conda create -n luna python=3.9
conda activate luna
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdir results
```

### Step 1. Set up Containers (Optional)
In most cases, you don't need to do this section by yourself. However, if you are curious, there is something you can check out:
* Knowledge Graph (see https://shorturl.at/lyKTZ)
* LLM Inference Engine (run 'start_llm.sh')

### Step 2. Run the Code
If you would like to use pre-defined config in the 'data' folder, please try:
```shell
python worker.py --config_path [CONFIG_PATH]
```

Otherwise, you can also try this one. The script will help you to generate the config:
```shell
python worker.py
```

Please feel free to let me know if you have any concerns. Thank you!
