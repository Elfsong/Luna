=====================
When DNAC ssh’s to NAD on the traditional port, its passes through and Inventory collection and other automation feature works as anticipated. However, when its SSH’s over 830 on Netconf, it’s gets denied.

The denial occurs because Netconf yang packet doesn’t contain remote address (DNAC address) in the TACAS request. This is a known behavior, and an enhancement has been raised for this CSCvx47585","","C9300-48U","cat9k_iosxe.16.12.04.SPA.bin","","","3","","Software Bug","DNAHW","Cisco DNA Center - On-Prem","Cisco DNA Center - Infrastructure (Services, UI, API, etc.)","","","","","",""

Problem Details: SDA - Fabric Edge C9300 experiencing MAC flooding from specific ports and observing inconsistent in device-tracking IPDT policy applied to ports.  We see inconsistent in the IPDT policy applied to the ports.  Some switch ports are configured with IPDT_POLICY and some are with IPDT_MAX_10.

- whether the IPDT policy differs based on the code the device is running.
- whether the IPDT policy 'limit address-count' can help to address the MAC flooding issue.

This process caters to two simultaneous faults in the system.
  *   The two faults are, the process misses 3 HBs with remote XR VM, and Sysadmin VM on the remote card is down too. In case of such double failure, rvm_mgr takes action of reloading the remote card as a recovery mechanism.
  *   The connectivity failure between the cards was further confirmed from the below ping report, when the first HB is missed with XR VM, ping test is recorded.
  *   If ping result says 100% packet loss, this means there is communication failure.

DNAC Version : 2.3.3.7 ( DN2-HW-APL-XL ) , 3 Node Cluster
 
On 4th of July Night at Singapore Time, the WLC was provisioned with additional Managed AP Locations where it was stuck for 9 Hours.
The Provision failed after 9 Hours of waiting with the below error :
 
A screenshot of a computer

Description automatically generated
 
The RCA Logs were generated after the failure for further investigation
The BU Escalation Team were involved and after analysis the Root Cause was identified as seen below :
 
Issue triggered due to duplication data in DB, resulting in Network Programmer running out of memory​.
CSCwf89617 is addressed in 2.3.3.7. The fix is applicable only for WLC provisioning flows done after upgrading to 2.3.3.7.
The duplicated data is present in database prior to the Upgrade to 2.3.3.7
new defect CSCwd49629 is raised to handle the old stale entries in DB which might be carried forward after during upgrade to 2.3.3.7 and which are not handled by CSCwf89617.
 
The Workaround that was provided to resolve this issue is as follows :
 
Prune the DCS table to nullify the data, to clear the duplicated data​.
Increase memory of network-programmer and spf-service​
 
Subsequent sessions involved applying the workaround and provisioning the WLC’s which all resulted in success.","DNAC Provision Issues after upgraded to Version 2.3.3.7-72328
Client is unable to provision a 5540 WLC.
He stated that during the previous BEMS interaction they needed to add the new sites in the Cisco DNA Center hierarchy and then provision the WLC so it can manage those sites.
They could successfully add the new sites.
Now they wanted to provision the WLC (without doing any changes, just adding the new sites to be managed) and the provisioning is stucked here:

The client requested a WebEx when the provisioning was not moving after over 2 hours of waiting.
I took a fresh set of RCA and checked the SPF logs:

Further details:

It is a production environment which was working without problems for more than 2 years
Is seems that issue was triggered after SDA L2 border switch experienced a power outage around 9 weeks ago
Issue currently affecting one VLAN/VN.
The VN name is res_access_VN and the VLAN name is vl_sciyih_bms (which is vlan 7 in the L2 handoff) and in SDA fabric it is vlan 1102

** As per the above outputs, I could see that drops value are ideally the same.
** These output drops will not be related to the random disconnect as we are not seeing AP getting disconnected from the WLC.
** So the output drops will not be a direct issue of wireless users' disconnection.","Output drops on AP connected interfaces","C9300-48U-A","16.12.4","16.12.4","49.0","3","100.0","Debug/Diagnostic Capability (missing, incomplete, cryptic...)","C9300","LAN Switching","Cat9300","01t1C000006fIcDQAU","Error Messages, Logs, Debugs","Cat9300","LAN Switching","01t15000005W0LTAA0","IRE: PARTIAL;SHERLOCK: PARTIAL"

* We can test connecting both WLC back to back and test if issue arises again, I understand it won’t be convenient but to conclude it to be a hardware issue we need to test the behavior by connecting both WLC back to back (or keeping max distance to 100 meters as we know: A direct physical connection between Active and Standby Redundant Ports is highly recommended. The distance between the connections can go up to 100 meters at per Ethernet cable standards.

OSPF was down. uplink ports shows green light. service also get down.","+++ As per logs. I don’t see any error related to behaviour we observed on the switch .
+++ Ideally such behaviour could have been result of memory leak, switch getting stuck in state, hardware programming error , or any unknown bugs.
+++ Since we had reloaded without collecting logs which needed to pin point such cases , we will not be able to proceed further .
+++ My best suggestion here would be to upgrade the Switch to latest stable code so that we can avoid any old known issue on 16.12.3.

1. To identify the packets that is causing the CPU spike, we need to enable the below debugs, please note these debugs can be run during the production and non-service impacting. 

Conft 
Ip access list extended TAC
Permit ip any any 

debug platform condition ipv4 access-list TAC both
debug platform packet-trace packet 8192 circular fia-trace
debug platform packet-trace punt code 11
debug platform packet-trace copy packet both size 256 L3

once the punt logs are observed please run the below commands and share the tac.txt file for further analysis.  
show platform packet-trace statistics | app tac.txt
show platform packet-trace summary | app tac.txt 
show platform packet-trace packet all | app tac.txt  ( wait for some time for router to copy all the packets )
show platform hardware qfp active infrastructure punt config cause 11 | app tac.txt
show platform software punt-policer drop-only | app tac.txt

Punt-policer is enabled by default, and it polices all the control plane punted traffic. When traffic for a specific punt cause exceeds the configured value, the packets will be dropped, and a log message printed, punt policer is enabled to control the CPU from becoming overwhelmed. Currently the high priority traffic threshold is 5000 
As we see the high priority packets are dropped, we can increase the threshold to 15000 and see if there is any drops. ( this can be applied later after getting the logs from debugs)

BGP router process,  Calculates the best BGP path and processes any route churn. It also sends and receives routes, establishes peers, and interacts with the routing information base (RIB).
To get more details we need to enable debugs on the router.

Increase Interface Input Queues
If BGP advertises thousands of routes to many peers, TCP must transmit thousands of packets in a short duration. The BGP peers receive these packets and send TCP acknowledgements to the BGP speaker that advertises, which causes the BGP speaker to receive a flood of TCP ACKs in a short period of time. If the ACKs arrive at a rate that is too high for the route processor, packets back up in inbound interface queues. By default, router interfaces use an input queue size of 75 packets. In addition, special control packets such as BGP UPDATES use a special queue with Selective Packet Discard (SPD). This special queue holds 100 packets. When BGP convergence, happens TCP ACKs can fill quickly the 175 spots of input buffering and the new packets that arrive must be dropped. On routers with 15 or more BGP peers and exchange of the full Internet routing table, over 10,000 drops per interface per minute can be seen. Here is example output from a router 15 minutes after reboot:
Router#show interface pos 8/0 | include input queue
Output queue 0/40, 0 drops; input queue 0/75, 278637 drops
Router#
If you increase the interface input queue depth (with the hold-queue in command) it helps reduce the number of dropped TCP ACKs, which reduces the amount of work BGP must do to converge. Normally, a value of 1000 resolves problems caused by input queue drops.

These are described in below doc and matches the issue we are seeing, there could be some peers which are advertising the routes in continuous interval.
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/107615-highcpu-bgp.html

++ Suggest increasing input que to 1000
interface tenGigabitEthernet 0/1/0
#hold-queue 1000 in

Punt-policer is enabled by default, and it polices all the control plane punted traffic. When traffic for a specific punt cause exceeds the configured value, the packets will be dropped, and a log message printed, punt policer is enabled to control the CPU from becoming overwhelmed. Currently the high priority traffic threshold is 5000 
As we see the high priority packets are dropped, we can increase the threshold to 15000 and see if there is any drops. ( this can be applied later after getting the logs from debugs)

BGP router process,  Calculates the best BGP path and processes any route churn. It also sends and receives routes, establishes peers, and interacts with the routing information base (RIB).
To get more details we need to enable debugs on the router.

Increase Interface Input Queues
If BGP advertises thousands of routes to many peers, TCP must transmit thousands of packets in a short duration. The BGP peers receive these packets and send TCP acknowledgements to the BGP speaker that advertises, which causes the BGP speaker to receive a flood of TCP ACKs in a short period of time. If the ACKs arrive at a rate that is too high for the route processor, packets back up in inbound interface queues. By default, router interfaces use an input queue size of 75 packets. In addition, special control packets such as BGP UPDATES use a special queue with Selective Packet Discard (SPD). This special queue holds 100 packets. When BGP convergence, happens TCP ACKs can fill quickly the 175 spots of input buffering and the new packets that arrive must be dropped. On routers with 15 or more BGP peers and exchange of the full Internet routing table, over 10,000 drops per interface per minute can be seen. Here is example output from a router 15 minutes after reboot:
Router#show interface pos 8/0 | include input queue
Output queue 0/40, 0 drops; input queue 0/75, 278637 drops
Router#
If you increase the interface input queue depth (with the hold-queue in command) it helps reduce the number of dropped TCP ACKs, which reduces the amount of work BGP must do to converge. Normally, a value of 1000 resolves problems caused by input queue drops.

These are described in below doc and matches the issue we are seeing, there could be some peers which are advertising the routes in continuous interval.

Problem Description: 
- DNAC Wireless Assurance health score shows 0 after May 15 9:00 PM SGT.
- Issue seen after provisioning the WLC.
- **Provisioning time:** May 15 @ 12:53 UTC.

Setup Info:
- DNAC version: 2.3.3.7
- WLC we are focusing:
    - **Hostname:** TLDC-WL-WLC01
    - **IP:** 172.18.240.13
    - **HW/SW:** AIR-CT8540-K9 / 8.10.183.0

Tshoot/Analysis:
-	We have seen that Wireless assurance is missing in DNAC since around May 15 9:00 PM SGT.
-	Checking WLC configuration we see that it is disabled.
-	Checking DNAC site settings we see that Wireless telemetry is disabled.
-	We also observed that around 8:53 PM SGT, the WLC was provisioned as part of another activity.
-	Suspect that the WLC was provisioned with Wireless telemetry disabled as per the site settings configured in DNAC.
-	However, the audit log details, or configuration preview do not indicate that wireless assurance was disabled.
-	You forced pushed the telemetry settings to WLC [172.18.240.13]  during MW on 20 May. However that does not seem to enable the WSA service on the WLC.
-	On further analysis, identified following defects which have been root caused to CSCvk62901 libssh2 library upgrade for WLC 
CSCvq42714 WLC WSA service is disabled after discovery and provisioning due to which it says unmonitored
CSCvp20941 Assurance configs are not getting pushed to WLC.
-	engaged Sudhanshu from WLC team who validated this in lab and it was working as expected.
-	In order to further isolate the issue and he requested following details.
o	Save the putty session of WLC and run the below debugs on WLC.
show logging config-history
debug emweb web enable
debug pm pki enable
o	Trigger the issue by doing 'Update Telemetry Settings' --> ""Force Configuration push"" from DNAC.
o	  After running the above debugs commands on WLC and triggering the issue from DNAC, wait for 10 min to collect the outputs on WLC, then close the SSH session and share the file.
o	  From DNAC side, upload the RCA file.

-	As per your last update,
Telemetry Settings for wlc01 had been updated on 4th of July and assurance got enabled for that WLC since then.
-	As per your request we monitored the status by end of the week and did not receive any further issues reported.","- DNAC Wireless Assurance health score shows 0 after May 15 9:00 PM SGT.

1)  This could be either no bogus mac addresses being sent from PC to switch during capture
2)  To rule this out, when the issue re-occurs, please perform a simultaneous capture on the switch and PC. 
        a.  Run the mac count command on the switch multiple times to show the mac addresses are incrementing. 
         b.  As workaround we tested by setting a client connected interface on one the switch from mult-auth to single-auth
                    i.  You may follow this during the next occurrence of the mac increments are spiking the CPU.

This is a generic HP and can be applied on any version and is available in CCO site, you could install it on all the nodes and monitor.

But we would suggests to install patch 6 first and then install this HP.

This bug is addressed in ISE 3.0 p7 which is yet to be released, until then you can install patch 6 first and then the HP over it.
